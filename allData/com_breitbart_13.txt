Report: Young Border Crossers Cost American Taxpayers $1.4B Last Year
 
Sheltering unaccompanied minors who crossed the United States-Mexico border cost American taxpayers more than $1 billion last year, a new report reveals.

In 2017, a total of $1.4 billion in taxpayer money was spent on housing unaccompanied minors and keeping them comfortable, the Washington Times‘ Stephen Dinan reports. Each unaccompanied minor costs taxpayers $670 each day.

As Breitbart News reported, more than 13,000 unaccompanied minors were resettled across the country in Fiscal Year 2018, with less than four percent of unaccompanied minors being deported.
