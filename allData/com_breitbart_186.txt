Chelsea Clinton Reacts to Samantha Bee: ‘Grossly Inappropriate’ to Describe Ivanka Trump as a ‘Feckless C**t’
 
Former first daughter Chelsea Clinton reacted on Thursday to Samantha Bee describing President Donald Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump as a “feckless c**t.”

“It’s grossly inappropriate and just flat-out wrong to describe or talk about Ivanka Trump or any woman that way,” Chelsea Clinton responded on Twitter when asked by Breitbart News for her reaction to the controversy.

Bee berated Ivanka Trump for posting a picture of her child on Instagram.

“You know, Ivanka, that’s a beautiful photo of you and your child,” Samantha Bee said on her TBS comedy show on Wednesday night. “But let me just say, one mother to another, do something about your dad’s immigration practices, you feckless c**t!”

The White House demanded TBS and Time Warner give a response.

“Her disgusting comments and show are not fit for broadcast and executives at Time Warner and TBS must demonstrate that such explicit profanity about female members of this administration will not be condoned on its network,” White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement to reporters.
