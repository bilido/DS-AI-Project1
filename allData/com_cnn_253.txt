2 men wanted after blast injures 15 people at restaurant near Toronto
 
(CNN) A manhunt is on in Canada after two men detonated an improvised explosive device, injuring 15 people late Thursday inside a restaurant in Mississauga, Ontario, near Toronto, police said.

"There's no indication this is a terrorist attack. There's no indication this is a hate crime," Peel Regional Police Chief Jennifer Evans said during a Friday morning news conference. "At this time, we haven't ruled anything out as we start our investigation."

The suspects walked into the Bombay Bhel Indian restaurant in the city outside Toronto around 10:30 p.m. and detonated the device, police said. They then fled, police believe, in a vehicle, Evans said.

Surveillance photos show the men wearing jeans and dark-colored hoodies. One had his face covered with a black cloth, police said.

Two parties, including a birthday celebration, were going on at the restaurant at the time of the blast, Evans said.
