The crash occurred Friday evening in Kiryandongo, a town about 140 miles north of the capital, Kampala.

"We continue to thank all those that have been working in saving lives plus the Police officers that worked since last evening in service of the people," the Uganda Police Force tweeted from its official account Saturday. "Quick recovery to the injured. RIP to the dead."
