Of the more than 11.66 million people currently living in Ohio, 8.15 million are on Facebook and 2.89 million are Republicans.

The Western Journal’s political survey targeted these 2.89 million Republicans in Ohio.

The poll consisted of three different audiences: people affiliated with the Republican Party, people who identified as conservative, and people who were both affiliated with the Republican Party and also identified themselves as conservative.

The audience demographic consisted of fluent English speakers of all genders who were at least 18 years old.

The information, comments and visits from The Western Journal’s millions of Facebook followers allow The Western Journal to invite likely primary voting Facebook registrants in Ohio, and other states nationwide, to participate in the surveys we conduct with a high confidence rate that the voters we asked to respond, will actually vote. More importantly, the makeup of those who respond to The Western Journal’s surveys indicates the population of registered voters that will turn out and vote in the Nov. 6, 2018, primary.

Each respondent’s entries reported in the article are supported by a name, email address and zip code matched against voter file and other databases available to confirm voter eligibility in the state, districts and precincts targeted in this survey. Responses were statistically balanced using Facebook’s Artificial Intelligence tools and programs available to The Western Journal for this program, some of which are proprietary due to our scale and reputation.
