Senator James Lankford (R-OK) spoke with Brian Kilmeade about his new Make Congress Work Again initiative which would help speed up Senate confirmations of judges and executive nominations and having the Senate work "smarter" including nights, weekends and throughout scheduled recess periods. Lankford pointed out that President Trump has had 94 nominations that Democrats have given cloture requests, meaning they needed a 30-hour debate period in the Senate, while at the same point in his first term President Obama only had 17 cloture requests on nominations from Republicans. Lankford's plan to streamline this process would be to shorten the 30-hour debate period on nominations to eight hours.
