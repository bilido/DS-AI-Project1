Todd Starnes spoke with Jeff Stein, the News & Program Director for News-Talk 1540 KXEL in Iowa, about why rallies like the one President trump held in Tennessee was so successful and why the President's message resonates with the heartland of America.

"The President is doing what he said he would do and they like that. That is new for a politician. They like somebody who is taking charge, they may not like everything he's doing, but they like the style, and it is a sharp contrast. So the rumors of his demise are greatly exaggerated shall we say when you talk to actual voters," Stein said.
