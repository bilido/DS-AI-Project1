Senator Mike Lee: I Don’t Think It’s That Easy Of A Choice For The President To Speak With Mueller
 
Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) spoke with Brian Kilmeade about the friction between President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, why the FBI should have informed President Trump they had concerns about people involved in his campaign, Mitt Romney running for the Senate in Utah and the tombstone of President Andrew Jackson being vandalized. When asked about Congressman Trey Gowdy saying President Trump should speak with Robert Mueller, Senator Lee said, "I don't think it's that easy of a Choice" for the President to speak with Mueller.

Plus, Senator Lee discussed his book "Written Out of History: The Forgotten Founders Who Fought Big Government" which is available now in paperback.
