Matthew West’s Tribute To Rev. Billy Graham At The K-LOVE Awards
 
Todd Starnes spoke with musician Matthew West about co-hosting the 6th Annual K-LOVE Fan Awards this year, as well his decision to pay tribute to Rev. Billy Graham at the event.

"We're going to be doing a tribute to Rev. Billy Graham, who had a profound impact on my life. He's a big reason why I do what I do today. Because of the way that he lived his life and because of me as a 13-year-old kid watching a Billy Graham Crusade on television, that was a defining moment in my life," West said.
