General Michael Hayden on North Korea Summit: If The President Goes In There More Worried About The Trump Brand…This Could End Up In A Bad Place
 
General Michael Hayden, former Director of the NSA & CIA and author of the new book "The Assault on Intelligence: American National Security in an Age of Lies", joined Fox News Radio's Guy Benson & Marie Harf to talk about a variety of topics including North Korea, Trump's Presidency & Gina Haspel's confirmation.

On North Korea: The good news is we have not seen much Presidential taunting in the last 4 months or so...so that's good. I am trying to be hopeful. (1:00)

On President Trump negotiating with Kim: This is one moment where I don't think zero sum is going to work. He (Trump) is going to have to look for a win here. (1:50)

On his biggest fear out of a Trump/Kim Meeting: If the President goes in there more worried about the Trump brand and the art of the deal rather than the art of the possible this could end up in a bad place. (4:00)

On an Erosion of Trust: Our community (the intel Tribe) needs to be more transparent with the American people about what it is that they do. It will shave points of our effectiveness, but we are going to need to do that otherwise we will not have the validation of the American people. (8:15)

On Gina Haspel's confirmation process/enhanced interrogations: Gina did very well during the hearings. She was very careful with her words. I get the moral argument, but I think its unfair for people 15 years later looking back trying to impute some sense of moral guilt on people who acted in good faith doing what we believed the will of the American people.
