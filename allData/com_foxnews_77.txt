Tesla's guitarist chats with Fox's Laura Ingle about his newest project in today's "Bonus Track":

Fans of the rock band Tesla, know the screaming licks of guitarist Frank Hannon well:

(Hannon) "I'm known as the lead guitarist of Tesla and I love playing lead guitar, don't get me wrong, but I also love singing."

Hannon sat down with me in our studios with his guitar to talk about his solo cover song project, now in its second installment 'From one place to Another! Vol. 2' and the motivation behind it:

(Hannon) "Peter Frampton, Joe Walsh, Rick Derringer, Ted Nugent, those kind of guitar players that sing, that's always been something that I love."

He also got a huge push to pursue singing from Dickey Betts of the Allman Brothers Band:

(Hannon) "He encouraged me to to learn a bunch of different songs and said that's how you learn to sing... (Ingle): Is he like a coach? (Hannon): He's my father-in-law, I married his daughter. (Ingle): That's amazing. (Hannon): Yeah it is amazing, she's amazing."

Between touring with Tesla and playing his solo stuff, all signs point to some killer music coming at you this summer.

Laura Ingle...
