President Trump slammed Democratic leaders at a Tennessee rally Tuesday night, labeling former Gov. Phil Bredesen, a Democrat in the running to replace retiring Sen. Bob Corker, as an "absolute total tool of Chuck Schumer and, of course, the MS-13 lover Nancy Pelosi."

Todd Starnes spoke to Tennessee Star founder and political strategist Steve Gill about how Gov. Bredsen seems to be hiding his liberal Democratic views, and how he has earned the nickname "Phillary."

"We're dubbing him 'Phillary,' to tie into the Hillary Clinton ties. He's going to try to pretend he's anything but a Democrat, anything but a liberal. He's running a stealth campaign because he can't run as who he is and hope to have Tennesseans vote for him. Marsha Blackburn is proudly as Trump Republican conservative and that's what Tennessee is and ultimately that's what's going to carry the day," Gill said.
