Franklin Graham, the President and CEO of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, wants people to pray to God asking him to heal the political, racial and cultural divisions plaguing the country. He recently launched the "Decision America California Tour" and talked to Todd Starnes about the importance of Christians not only going out to vote, but to run for office as well.

"We need Christian legislators, we need Christian mayors, we need Christians on the city council. When I say Christians, I'm talking about Christians who are willing to take a stand for biblical truth, what the bible has to say about marriage, what the bible has to say about the sanctity of life and who are willing to stand behind God's principles," Graham said.
