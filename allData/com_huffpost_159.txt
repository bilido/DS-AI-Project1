Olympian Adam Rippon's Oscar Tux And Harness Are Gold Medal-Worthy
 
Olympian Adam Rippon knows how to ensure all eyes are on him.

The 28-year-old figure skater showed up to the 2018 Oscars red carpet in an S&M-inspired tuxedo from Moschino with a leather harness.

He completed his look with a bow tie and black loafers, essentially stealing the show before the show even started.

“Dressed to impress in @moschino,” the bronze medalist wrote on Instagram a few days before the ceremony. “Getting ready for the Oscars with @accessonline! Huge thank you to the brill, beautiful, and kind @itsjeremyscott 🙆🏼‍♂️
