Rihanna Had The Best Response To Being Asked If She Was Attending The Royal Wedding
 
Rihanna and Prince Harry have hung out together a few times. But as one reporter found out the hard way, that doesn’t mean the “Work” singer is attending the upcoming royal wedding.

In an interview with Access a few days ago, a reporter asked her if she was invited to Harry and Meghan Markle’s big day.

“Why would you think I’m invited?” Rihanna said, giving the reporter a look.

“I don’t know. You met him,” the reporter said.

“OK, you met me. You think you’re coming to my wedding?” she said with a laugh. “Am I coming to yours?”
