Try Not To Cry Watching David Beckham Tear Up Over Son's Birthday Surprise
 
It’s been well-established that no one can bend it like David Beckham, but who knew no one could hug quite like him either?

The former footballer rang in his 43rd birthday on Wednesday with a surprise appearance from his oldest son, Brooklyn. The family was out celebrating at a London restaurant when the 19-year-old snuck up behind his father in a video shared on both David and wife Victoria Beckham’s Instagram accounts.

David became instantly emotional, tearing up as his son pulled him in for a sweet embrace.

“What are you doing here?” a clearly overwhelmed David said in the video after giving him a kiss on the cheek. “I missed you so much.”
