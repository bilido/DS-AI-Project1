Meghan Markle's Father, Who Has Never Met Prince Harry, Will Walk Her Down The Aisle
 
One of the biggest questions surrounding the royal wedding has finally been answered.

Meghan Markle’s father, Thomas Markle, will walk the former “Suits” actress down the aisle at her May 19 nuptials to Prince Harry, after previous speculation that Markle would be escorted by her mother, Doria Ragland.

The prince’s press secretary confirmed the news on Friday in a statement filled with updates on the upcoming wedding.

“Both of the bride’s parents will have important roles in the wedding,” the statement said. “On the morning of the wedding, Ms. Ragland will travel with Ms. Markle by car to Windsor Castle. Mr. Markle will walk his daughter down the aisle of St. George’s Chapel. Ms. Markle is delighted to have her parents by her side on this important and happy occasion.”

The press secretary added Meghan Markle’s parents will arrive a week before the wedding in order to meet and get to know the rest of the royal family, including the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall, and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

While Markle’s mother has met Prince Harry before, this will be the first time that Markle’s father has met the prince in person.

Markle said shortly after her engagement that her father and her fiancé had spoken to each other over the phone.
