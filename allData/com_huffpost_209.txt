Charlize Theron Gets Real About Motherhood: 'Sometimes I Lose My Mind'
 
Charlize Theron knows motherhood can be really, really challenging.

“Raising kids is not through rose-colored lenses. There is real grit to it,” the actress and mother of two told Us Weekly on Wednesday at the premiere of her new movie, “Tully.”

Theron, the single mother of Jackson, 6, and August, 2, said she often relies on parenting advice from her own mom, Gerda Maritz.

“I think every piece of advice has been really good from my mom,” she said. “She’s like, ‘You know, what, tomorrow is going to be a new day. It’s not the end of the world.’”

She added: “Sometimes I lose my mind especially in a car, like when we’re on a road trip or something, She’ll look at me and laugh ... Then she’ll say, ’It’s just a moment. It’s going to pass. It’s going to pass.’”
