Prince Harry and Meghan Markle — now the Duke and Duchess of Sussex — are officially husband and wife!

The royal and former actress wed Saturday at St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle in front of 600 guests, including celebrities like Elton John, Serena Williams and Oprah. Everything ― from the weather to the vows to Markle’s gorgeous Givenchy gown ― was perfect.
