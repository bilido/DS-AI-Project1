10 Primers With SPF You Need For Healthy Summer Skin
 
If there's a season to start wearing makeup primer, it's summer.

For those who need a primer on primer, it's the step before you apply foundation. When the weather starts heating up, it can be hard to keep makeup from sliding off your face, but not if you utilize primer first.

Not only does primer keep your makeup intact, it also creates a smoother base to work with. Worn on its own, primer can blur out blemishes and give you a more polished appearance on days when you don't want to put on foundation.

But not all primers are created equal and when it comes to summer skincare, it's important to pick one that offers broad spectrum sun protection. Before the sun gets any more intense, do yourself a favour and pick up a great primer with SPF. Your skin will thank you in the long run.
