Taylor Swift Told To Shower By Cheeky Interviewer And Fans React
 
A bit of dry British humor on a muggy day did not amuse some Taylor Swift fans.

BBC Radio 1’s Greg James lightheartedly told the pop superstar “I think you need to have a shower now” after she performed at the Biggest Weekend festival in Swansea, Wales, on Sunday.

A sweaty Swift, who sang an energetic six-song set in high humidity, appeared to take the comment in stride.

“I agree,” she said. “And I’m not offended that you said that. There’s a lot going on and none of it’s good here.”
