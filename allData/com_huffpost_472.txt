WATCH: The 'Sanju' Trailer Is Here And It Looks Dope AF
 
Rajkumar Hirani and Ranbir Kapoor launched the trailer of the Sanjay Dutt biopic, titled Sanju, in a Juhu multiplex in Mumbai on Wednesday. The event saw loud cheers from the media fraternity that had gathered to attend the trailer launch.

Kapoor plays Dutt film that has been penned by Hirani and his frequent collaborator, Abhijat Joshi (3 Idiots, PK). While one expected the film to bear a somber tone, given the tumultuous life that Dutt has led, Hirani has instead given the trailer a light-hearted comedic treatment.

The 3-minute trailer touches on key events in Dutt's life -- his battle with drug addiction, the many women he slept with (it says the number was over 300) and his jail term for illegally possessing AK 56 rifles.

Kapoor looks like he has seamlessly merged with Dutt's persona, right from body language to voice modulation, this looks like a performance that can further solidify the actor's position as one of the best of our time.

Other than him, the film features an ensemble that includes Sonam Kapoor, Dia Mirza, Paresh Rawal, Vicky Kaushal and Manisha Koirala (who plays his mother, Nargis Dutt).

Anushka Sharma will also be seen in a special appearance, as his biographer.

The film is slated to release on June 29. Watch the trailer here.
