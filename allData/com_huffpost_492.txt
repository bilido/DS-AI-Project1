This Hilarious 'Race 3' Meme Posted By Mumbai Police Has Twitter In Splits
 
That Mumbai Police's Twitter handle has a witty social-media manager taking care of the account is no secret. Always attuned to the latest pop-culture phenomenon, the account often posts hilarious memes that feature messages about safety and security in a clever way.

Earlier on Wednesday, Mumbai Police jumped on the now-popular Race 3 meme wagon, which trolls actress Daisy Shah's dialogue, "Our business is our business, none of your business," from the upcoming thriller.

Here's what the Mumbai Police tweeted:

Mind your own data to make sure that no one else takes advantage of it to beat you in the #RaceOfSafety pic.twitter.com/WJ4ADZEl1a — Mumbai Police (@MumbaiPolice) May 23, 2018

The tweet has already been RT'd over 2000 times, with several users praising Mumbai Police's social media game.

Interestingly, Race 3 features Salman Khan in the lead role, who's not had the best relationship with the cops.

A few days ago, when the meme, "Ghar se nikalte hi, kuch door chalte hi" become an online rage, Mumbai Police once again went hyper-viral with a genius post.

Ghar se Kuch dur nikalte chalte

hi... hi... pic.twitter.com/1nSWbB0H92 — Mumbai Police (@MumbaiPolice) May 16, 2018

Even before, when Twitter was losing it on the "If you don't love me at my worst, you don't deserve me at my best," memes this is the gem that the cops had posted. Whoever handles the account, clearly deserves a raise.
