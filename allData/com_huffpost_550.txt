Just In: Ranbir Kapoor Confirms He's Dating Alia Bhatt
 
After months of speculations, Ranbir Kapoor has finally confirmed what industry insiders have known all along -- he's dating Alia Bhatt.

In an interview with GQ, the actor said that he is dating Alia and the relationship needs 'time to breathe' right now.

Although both actors have openly spoken about their admiration for each other's work, this is the first time any of them has opened up about a relationship.

When asked if he's dating Alia Bhatt, Kapoor said, "It's really new right now, and I don't want to overspeak. It needs time to breathe and it needs space. As an actor, as a person, Alia is — what's the right word — flowing right now. When I see her work, when I see her act, even in life, what she gives is something that I'm aspiring to for myself."

Interestingly, Bhatt is very close to Katrina Kaif, Kapoor's ex-girlfriend who he broke-up with, in 2016.

About being newly in love, Kapoor said, "It always comes with a lot of excitement. It's a new person, it comes with new beats. Old tricks become new tricks again — you know, being charming and romantic, all of that. I think I'm more balanced today. I value relationships more. I can appreciate hurt and what it does to a person much more than I could a couple years back."

Kapoor previously dated Deepika Padukone while Bhatt was seeing her Student of the Year co-star, Sidharth Malhotra.
