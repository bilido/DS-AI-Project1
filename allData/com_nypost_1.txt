Trump jokes about his social skills at kids sports event
 
WASHINGTON – President Trump, who is skilled at exercising his fingers on his cellphone, told kids about the importance of putting down their electronics and picking up sports.

Sweating on the practice field will build patience, integrity, teamwork and “social skills,” Trump told young people Wednesday at a White House fitness event.

Then the president paused and asked the crowd whether he has such qualities.

“Do I have social skills?” Trump quipped. “I don’t know.”

“I have social media that’s for sure,” Trump said, referring to his heavy daily dose of tweeting. ”I don’t know about skill, but I have a lot of media!”

The gathering at the White House with about 250 young athletes, coaches and parents was designed to boost youth sports participation, which has been on the decline, according to the White House.

Trump appointed several former pro athletes to lead his Council on Sport, Fitness, and Nutrition, including former Yankees pitcher Mariano Rivera.

Trump gushed that Rivera was one of the greatest pitchers of all time and pondered whether he ever got bored of winning. Rivera shook his head “no.”

Trump then quizzed Rivera about how he was able to break so many bats with his pitches.

“Exactly how do you do that? Can you explain that please?” Trump said.

“There’s one explanation,” Rivera said. “That was a pitch from heaven.”

Trump wasn’t buying it.

“It’s called talent,” Trump told the kids.
