These sex robots are equipped with artificial intelligence
 
Shenzhen Atall Intelligent Robot Technology, one of China's leading robotics companies, is now selling Emma, a sex robot equipped with artifical intelligence. The machine is linked to the internet and features high-tech stimulation capabilities. Sex robots have soft and elastic skin with less oil content and no smell. Their temperatures are set to resemble a human's and even feature safety measures to prevent electric shock, fire and explosions. But the human resemblance doesn't come cheap; Emma costs about $3,136 online with most customers being men aged between 40 and 50 years old.
