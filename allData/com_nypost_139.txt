Delta says ‘unruly’ customer caused flight diversion
 
TULSA, Okla. — A Delta Air Lines flight from Portland, Oregon, to Atlanta was diverted to Tulsa, Oklahoma, Wednesday because of an onboard disturbance involving a passenger.

Tulsa International Airport spokeswoman Alexis Higgins said Delta flight 1156 landed about 11:30 a.m. and that the passenger was removed to be questioned by the FBI.

Higgins said she did not know the nature of the disturbance and a Delta spokesman did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment.

FBI spokeswoman Andrea Anderson in Oklahoma City confirmed the agency is investigating but referred questions to the US Attorney’s office in Tulsa. A phone call seeking comment was not immediately returned.

In a statement, Delta said the flight was diverted because of an “unruly passenger” but that it landed without incident. The airline apologized to other passengers who were inconvenienced because of the delay.

Higgins said the aircraft refueled and resumed the flight to Atlanta about 1:35 p.m.
