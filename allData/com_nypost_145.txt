Jesse Williams is dating sports anchor Taylor Rooks
 
“Grey’s Anatomy” star Jesse Williams is dating stunning SportsNet New York anchor Taylor Rooks — sources exclusively tell Page Six — after moving on from his breakup with Minka Kelly earlier this year.

We hear that Williams and Rooks were spotted together at Kevin Hart’s comedy show at Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, NJ, over Memorial Day Weekend on a date.

An insider told us: “They are eager to keep their romance under wraps. He’s been going through a difficult divorce [from Aryn Drake-Lee], but he’s found solace with Taylor.”

Williams filed for divorce last year.

The source added of Williams and Rooks, “The two slipped into Atlantic City for 24 hours” on Saturday.

Oddly, the pair were rumored to have stayed at an Atlantic City hotel — the Ocean Resort Casino — before it opens next month, as the only two guests in the 1,400-room resort. (Sounds like it could be a romantic version of “The Shining.”)

But sources close to the TV star — as well as a rep for the hotel — shot down the cozy creepy concept.

Rooks has become a rising star for her “TimeOut With Taylor Rooks” YouTube show and podcast, which has recently included interviews with guests including Meek Mill, Dion Waiters and Dwyane Wade.

Reps for Rooks and Williams did not comment.
