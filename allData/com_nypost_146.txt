London stylist claims Jessie J lacks the cash for his services
 
Fashion insiders were horrified when a stylist sent out a mass email discussing the finances of a client, “Bang Bang” singer Jessie J.

We’re told that London-based Zadrian Smith — who’s dressed stars including new “Solo: A Star Wars Story” actress Lily Newmark — emailed designers across the globe saying that he was “no longer working with” the star “due to an issue regarding the inability to provide appropriate budget for the services being provided.”

Industry insiders called the unusual move needlessly gauche.

Although there was no reference to it in the email, a rep for Smith claimed that the message was about a specific event — which they declined to name or even describe — and that “the budgets were set forth by the organizer of the event and ultimately, were simply below Zadrian’s normal working rate. This has nothing to do with budgets from Jessie J herself or her team, nor have we, as Zadrian’s reps, had any collection issues with them.”

High-flying Jessie J just announced a fall tour to support her new album, “R.O.S.E.”

Besides singing her own tunes, Jessie’s also become known for writing hits for other stars, including the Miley Cyrus smash “Party in the U.S.A.,” Chris Brown’s “I Need This” and “Repeat” for David Guetta.
