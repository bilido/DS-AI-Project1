Roseanne Barr says her Twitter rant was ‘insensitive, not racist’
 
Roseanne Barr ​resorted to the “I’m not a racist” line of defense amid a day of lashing out at all comers on Twitter Wednesday — ​also ​declaring her ​comparison of a black former Obama senior aide to an ape “insensitive, not racist​.​”

“I’m not a racist, I never was & I never will be,” Barr tweeted​ a day after her rants got the successful “Roseanne” reboot canceled and all her old episodes pulled from the air​.

“One stupid joke in a lifetime of fighting 4 civil rights 4 all minorities, against networks, studios, at the expense of my nervous system/family/wealth will NEVER b taken from me,” she said.

The embattled TV star has been getting blasted on social media for being a “racist” and “bigot” following her “planet of the apes” tweet about ​ex-Obama staffer Valerie ​Jarrett.

Barr, who is now unemployed, has even been getting called out by her supporters.

“Yes. Her joke was racist and in poor taste. She apologized and deleted the tweet BEFORE the s–t hit the fan,” wrote one Twitter user.

“Stop saying that,” Barr replied. “It was insensitive not racist.”

The onetime ’90s icon was also retweeting messages of support Wednesday, which seemed to fire her up.

“You guys make me feel like fighting back,” Barr tweeted. “I will examine all of my options carefully and get back to U.”
