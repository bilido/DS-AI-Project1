Wife shot husband in head over a Google search: cops
 
A Florida couple’s feud over a Google search quickly escalated to violence when the wife reportedly shot her husband in the head, according to police.

Tony Brown, a prominent businessman, was discovered in a pool of blood Monday at his Fernandina Beach home after his 57-year-old wife, Lawanda Brown, allegedly wounded him, news station WPTV reported.

The 58-year-old husband, who owns a consulting agency with his wife, was nominated in 2001 by President George W. Bush for a position in the US Treasury Department. He also served as a former Riviera Beach Community Redevelopment Agency director.

The couple’s source of conflict Monday stemmed from a project they were working on for their business, according to Nassau County Sheriff’s Office.

Lawanda Brown claimed that her husband asked her to search Google for a project template but she became upset with his tone of voice. She told investigators that the last thing she remembered was her husband walking out of the room and then her memory became “a blur.”

Deputies arrived at the home around 1 p.m. to find the man was shot in the back of the head. He was airlifted to the hospital in critical condition, according to WPTV.

The wife was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. She remained in custody Wednesday at Nassau County Jail, where she is being held on $500,002 bail, according to court records.
