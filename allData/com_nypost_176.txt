Ex-Vogue staffer busted for stealing $50K from top editor
 
A onetime Vogue staffer has been ​arrested and charged with stealing more than $50,000 from renowned model and former Vogue creative director​-at​-large Grace Coddington, sources told The Post.

Dublin-born Yvonne Bannigan, who worked as an assistant for the flame-haired catwalk and fashion icon before she was arrested, rang up $53,564 in unauthorized purchases on the former editor’s credit card, according to court documents and a law enforcement source.

Bannigan ran up the obscene tab before she was arrested in April 2018, the criminal complaint​ alleges​.

She’s also accused of selling property belonging to Coddington — identified in court papers as “Informant 1” — on online luxury consignment store TheRealReal, and kept the $9,000 of commission for herself.

The 25-year-old​ says on her LinkedIn ​page that before she worked for Coddington, she interned at ELLE ​magazine.

Bannigan also appeared in a Teen Vogue spread alongside Coddington in September 2016.

The former fashion assistant faces felony charges of second and third-degree grand larceny.

“We believe there’s been a misunderstanding which we hope will be sorted out,” attorney Michael Cornacchia said. “She has prior no record, and she’s a naturalized US citizen.”

“She didn’t do anything wrong,” he added.
