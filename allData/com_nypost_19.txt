Joy Reid reportedly once touted notorious 9/11 conspiracy film
 
MSNBC host Joy Reid once trumpeted an infamous, conspiratorial 9/11 film that labeled the terrorist attacks as an inside job, according to a report Wednesday.

March, 2006, on her now-defunct blog ReidBlog, she encouraged followers to watch “Loose Change” — an 80-minute film produced in part by Infowars’ Alex Jones, BuzzFeed News reported.

“Loose Change” is considered a seminal work among 9/11 truthers, who believe the US government had a role in the attacks. Its central claims have long been debunked.

“The fundamental question is: do you believe the official story of 9/11?” according to Reid’s post.

“If you do, great. If you don’t, then everything that happened after that is called into serious question. Even if you’re agnostic, or you tend to believe that al-Qaida attacked the World Trade Center and Pentagon and that the government had no warning such a thing could happen, it’s worth taking a second look.”

Reid and MSNBC could not be reached for comment.

Reid came under fire late last year when old blog posts showed her making a string of insensitive LBGT remarks.

She mocked then-Florida Gov. Charlie Crist as “Miss Charlie” and attacked Fox News Channel commentator Ann Coulter with transgender stereotypes.

Reid first said she had been hacked, but then later apologized.

The host of MSNBC’s “AM Joy” has come under increased scrutiny since Tuesday, when ABC abruptly cancelled Roseanne Barr’s hit sitcom after she made a string of racist, anti-Semitic tweets.
