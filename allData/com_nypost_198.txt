Village Voice editor-in-chief quietly leaves company
 
The Village Voice Editor-in-Chief Stephen Mooallem has quietly left the company, The Post has learned.

The former executive editor of Harper’s Bazaar, who was hired in December 2016, exited in mid-March under what a company spokeswoman described as “amicable” terms.

A successor has yet to be named, and currently the Voice news side is being run by a four-person team — senior editors Neil deMause and David Swanson, art director Ashley Smestad Vélez and copy editor Nina Pearlman.

The exit comes at a volatile time for the former alternative news leader, which closed the free weekly print edition last August.

Owner Peter Barbey has focused instead on the publication’s digital presence, but in a crowded landscape it has been difficult to retain its relevance.

Mooallem was the Voice’s third editor under Barbey, who in early 2016 replaced top editor with Will Bourne, who ran the paper for eight months before getting the boot.
