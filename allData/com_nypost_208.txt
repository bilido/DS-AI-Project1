Kilauea volcano eruption forces evacuations in Hawaii
 
Kilauea volcano fissures have appeared throughout residential areas on Hawaii's Big Island. The rolling lava and ash plumes have forced residents to evacuate the areas as they watch their properties be consumed by flames. Here, Zivile Roditis (R) walks up her driveway as her home burns due to lava from a volcano fissure, in Leilani Estates in Pahoa, Hawaii.
