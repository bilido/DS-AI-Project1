Lava and 'laze' in Hawaii
 
Lava burns trees as it flows toward the ocean near Pahoa, Hawaii. Two fissures that opened up in a rural Hawaii community have merged to produce faster and more fluid lava. Scientists say the characteristics of lava oozing from fissures in the ground has changed significantly as new magma mixes with decades-old stored lava.
