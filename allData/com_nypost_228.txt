Mangano jury ‘deadlocked’ day after restarting deliberations
 
The jury weighing corruption charges against former Nassau County Executive Edward Mangano said it was at an impasse on Wednesday — one day after starting over from scratch following the replacement of a panelist.

The eighth day of deliberations saw the jury send out a note at about 12:30 p.m. stating, “We are deadlocked.”

In response, Central Islip federal Judge Joan Azrack urged the jurors — midway through their 12th week of service — to try again to reach a verdict, saying: “There is no reason to believe this [case] can be tried any better or more ­exhaustively than it has been.”

The jury didn’t send out any more notes before being dismissed at 5 p.m., and was due to resume deliberations Thursday.
