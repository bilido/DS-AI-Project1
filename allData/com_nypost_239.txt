Prison guard says medication scam is getting squirrels stoned
 
Readers: I think you’ll get a kick out of this letter from a prison guard on the serious scam I’ve been writing about regarding prisoners and their medications.

This is also about squirrels with a drug problem.

Mr. Crudele: I retired after 27 years in New York State Corrections, of which 22 were as a Sergeant. So many of the state facilities actually have social workers and case workers whose full time job is to get inmates approved (for disability payments)!

We laugh and call the front of the Medical Building “Skittles Land,” since, in the snow, the thousands and thousands of mental health drugs that are either spit out, are coloring the ground. Or the inmate sells them to other inmates to get high.

My last facility was Midstate Correctional, and I’m here to tell you we had problems for years with squirrels and skunks eating the damn medications. We’d have tailless squirrels from running through the razor wire to get the meds and we have literally had an officer attacked on the walkway by a seemingly stoned squirrel.

The scam gets better. For example, we get a 65-year-old Spanish male who is non-English speaking and let’s say he has no formal education.

When they go through reception (after being admitted), they are given a battery of tests to determine jhis education level.

If they have less than a 6th grade reading level, inmates are forced to attend classes. Why? The Feds reimburse the state for the “student’s” lunch.
