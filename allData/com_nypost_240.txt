Justice Department may release report on Clinton investigation
 
I’m hearing that the release of the report from Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz is imminent.

The report could come out as soon as Thursday.

Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and his Judiciary Committee has a hearing scheduled for Tuesday, June 5, to go over the report.

I’m told by Grassley’s office that Horowitz will attend and will be questioned.

The IG has been looking into the FBI’s handling of the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation during the election. As I wrote while that probe was going on, then-FBI Director James Comey and a few bureau high-ups seemed to be covering up for Hillary.

I’m hearing that the report will be very critical of the former heads of the CIA and the FBI — as well as the agencies themselves.

The phrase “constitution crisis” keeps coming up and I don’t think that is an exaggeration as to what might happen because of the report’s findings, many of which will remain classified and not released. The Democrats will need to counter the report with a sizeable offensive.

On top of everything else going on, the markets will have to deal with the fallout from this report.
