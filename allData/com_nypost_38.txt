Why struggling Giancarlo Stanton won’t overhaul his swing
 
Last June, Giancarlo Stanton revamped his swing, adopting a closed stance that resulted in almost immediate success in Miami.

Stanton went from a home run every 14.6 plate appearances before June 19 to a homer every 9.8 plate appearances following the change.

Stanton is off to a rough start with the Yankees, but he said he wouldn’t undergo any significant alterations to his wing or approach this season.

“It’s too much of an adjustment to make in the middle of a season,’’ Stanton told The Post before going 1-for-2 with a walk and a sacrifice fly in Wednesday’s 5-3 win over the Astros.

Reminded he made the change during the middle part of last year, Stanton said he is already dealing with a different environment in The Bronx and a new league.

“To reverse everything now wouldn’t be good,’’ Stanton said. “Not with all the other new things around and the new surroundings.”

Instead, he and the Yankees will have to hope minor adjustments will be enough to make a difference.

“I’ve made tweaks and I feel like I’ve made some progress, but I take some steps forward and then some steps back,” Stanton said. “That’s kind of where I am right now. I’m working on little tweaks here and there.”

He has hit lefties well. Since April 27, Stanton is 15-for-33 with two doubles and five homers versus southpaws, but overall, he hasn’t approached the production expected when he was acquired from the Marlins in December.

The fact the Yankees have played well in spite of Stanton’s rough first two months has eased some of Stanton’s concerns, but he isn’t pleased with how his season has gone so far.

“There’s absolutely frustration,” Stanton said. “But the winning helps. Even with that, though, I still need to do more and will do more. … It’s not showing on the field, but I still feel like I’m getting there.”
