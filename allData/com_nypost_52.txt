Top interior designer asks $9M for gorgeous townhouse
 
Sarah Saltzberg, co-founder of Bohemia Realty Group, and seven of her Broadway-performer brokers — stars in their own right — are putting on a 90-minute performance to raise funds for Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS on June 7 at the Laurie Beechman Theatre at 407 W. 42nd St.

Saltzberg is co-writer of “Gettin’ the Band Back Together,” and a creator and star of “The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee.”

AD100 designer Steven Gambrel is selling his own 25-foot-wide townhouse at 68 Morton St. for $8.99 million.

The Greek revival-style brick property in the West Village, repped by Joshua Wesokyand Chad Longmore of Compass, comes with three bedrooms and five woodburning fireplaces.
