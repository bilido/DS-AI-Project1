Offset buys car for bystander who helped save his life
 
Offset — the Migos rapper who was nearly killed in a car crash two weeks ago — has decided to reward a bystander who helped “save” his life.

The man, identified only as Jamar, was apparently walking to work that day when he saw the accident unfold and spotted Offset trapped inside his mangled Dodge Charger with multiple injuries.

According to the rapper, Jamar doesn’t have a vehicle — so he had to pull the “Bad and Boujee” lyricist out of his car and usher him to safety on foot.

But that all changed Wednesday thanks to Offset, who chose to repay Jamar by buying him a Nissan Altima.

“THANK YOU [JAMAR] FOR HELPING SAVE MY LIFE,” the hip-hop star tweeted, along with a picture of Jamar’s new whip.

Offset took to Instagram, as well, to show off the Altima — which was gifted to Jamar exactly two weeks to the day of his accident.

“HE WAS WALKING FROM WORK WHEN HE SEEN ME CLIMBING OUT MY CAR,” Offset explained in a since-deleted Instagram post on Wednesday. “SO I BOUGHT HIM A CAR.”
