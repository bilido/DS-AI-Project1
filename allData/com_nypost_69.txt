Elizabeth Hurley: Wearing safety pin dress now could be depressing
 
It was the year 1994 when model Elizabeth Hurley was catapulted to international stardom thanks to a few well-placed safety pins.

Hurley stole the show in a plunging black Versace dress at the London premiere of “Four Weddings and a Funeral.”

But despite it being considered one of the most iconic outfits of all time, the 52-year-old wouldn’t be caught dead wearing the dress in 2018.

On the set of a photoshoot for Grazia UK, the “Royals” star declined the chance to don the iconic outfit if stylists could track it down.

“I’m not sure I would, to be honest. People don’t like to wear their wedding dresses again do they?” Hurley told the publication.

“I think you couldn’t look better in it second time around. I mean, 24 years on, you could end up feeling slightly depressed, so, no!

“That dress is definitely for someone 20 years younger than me.”

Hurley was attending the 1994 film screening on the arm of the romantic comedy’s star Hugh Grant and quickly shifted the spotlight from the actor, who she was dating at the time.

While relatively conservative by today’s red carpet standards, her dress made the front page of newspapers and Hurley a household name.

Today Hurley is still making headlines, this time for the age-defying photos she shares on Instagram, which she admits are mostly taken by her 16-year-old son Damien.
