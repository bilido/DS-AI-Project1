Perry Ellis founder sets deadline for offer to take company private
 
Perry Ellis is tired of founder George Felden­kreis’ public efforts to “mischaracterize” the company’s review of his offer to take the company private.

The Miami-based apparel maker said Thursday it is undergoing a “bona fide process” to review Felden­kreis’ offer of $27.50 a share.

But Feldenkreis, citing “unjustifiable delays” in Perry Ellis’ review process on Wednesday, threatened to withdraw his offer if an agreement wasn’t reached by May 29.
