Samantha Bee Apologizes After 'Vile and Vicious' Comment About Ivanka Trump
 
"Full Frontal" comedian Samantha Bee apologized Thursday shortly after calling Ivanka Trump a “feckless c***” on her show Wednesday evening.

"I crossed a line, and I deeply regret it," Bee said in a statement posted to Twitter.

I would like to sincerely apologize to Ivanka Trump and to my viewers for using an expletive on my show to describe her last night. It was inappropriate and inexcusable. I crossed a line, and I deeply regret it. — Samantha Bee (@iamsambee) May 31, 2018

White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders called Bee’s remarks “vile and vicious” and also condemned the initial lack of response from both the media and the network.

“The language used by Samantha Bee last night is vile and vicious. The collective silence by the left and its media allies is appalling,” Sanders said.

“Her disgusting comments and show are not fit for broadcast, and executives at Time Warner and TBS must demonstrate that such explicit profanity about female members of this administration will not be condoned on its network,” she added.

Bee’s remarks were inspired by a picture Ivanka posted of herself with her young son which Bee believed to be ill-timed.

"You know, Ivanka, that’s a beautiful photo of you and your child, but let me just say, one mother to another, do something about your dad’s immigration practices, you feckless c***!” Bee said. “He listens to you. Put on something tight and low cut and tell your father to f***ing stop it. Tell him it was an Obama thing and see how it goes.”
