Miami Herald: Gas prices hit a three-year high in Florida

Two weeks after Hurricane Irma spiked demand for gasoline in Florida, gas prices have hit a three-year high in Florida, according to AAA.

The current average in the Miami area is about $2.75 a gallon, according to a survey by GasBuddy.com.

Days before the school year started, state education officials forced Duval County Schools to remove 35 teachers from eight high-need schools.

VAM stands for value-added measure or value-added model. It features a complicated formula based on student academic growth, as measured on state tests, to judge teacher effectiveness.
