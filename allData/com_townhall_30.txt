Summit? No Summit? Pompeo Gives an Update on North Korea
 
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arrived in New York City yesterday for meetings with North Korean officials, including infamous spy chief Kim Yong Chol.

The goal of the meetings, which spanned into today, was to renegotiate a potential summit in Singapore between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jon Un. President Trump cancelled the summit last week after the North Korean regime threatened the United States with nuclear war and stopped answering phone calls about summit planning.

Pompeo will hold a press briefing with reporters in New York Thursday afternoon, but took to Twitter over the past 24-hours to update Americans on the progress.
