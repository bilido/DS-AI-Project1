Tomi Lahren: Take a Moment to Remember What Memorial Day Is Really About
 
Memorial Day 2018

It has turned into a day for grilling, beach parties, backyards and mattress sales, but Memorial Day is so much more than a day off from work.

It’s time for final thoughts.

I hope you’re enjoying Memorial Day with your friends and family. But please take a moment in the midst of your fun and relaxation to remember what this day is all about.

Memorial Day is a day to remember those who died in active military service. Without their service and sacrifice, we wouldn’t be able to enjoy all the things we enjoy today, or any day.

I want to use my “Final Thoughts” to pay tribute to those who have paid the ultimate price. Specifically, I want to recognize the members of our armed forces who have been killed in action so far in 2018.

Today is your day.

Specialist Gabriel David Conde

We salute you: all 13 of you, along with your families, friends and loved ones. It’s because of you that we live in the greatest nation on Earth. You fought bravely to protect and defend all of us, even those who are too troubled to stand for the flag and anthem.

Rest in peace knowing millions of patriotic and grateful Americans will always stand for you, in your memory, and with the utmost respect for what you’ve done for us and the rest of the free world. A hero remembered, never dies.

Those are my final thoughts. From LA, God bless you, God bless America, and take care.
