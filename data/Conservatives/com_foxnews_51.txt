Fox Business Network’s Maria Bartiromo On How Starbucks’ Controversy Affects the Market, “This is Not Really a Factor”
 
Maria Bartiromo, anchor of Mornings with Maria on Fox Business Network and Sunday Morning Futures on Fox News Channel, sat down with Starbucks CEO, Kevin Johnson, Wednesday morning to discuss the company's anti-bias training at stores across the country and their new bathroom policy. Maria joined Fox News Radio's Guy Benson and Marie Harf to discuss this interview and the volatility of the market.

On the authenticity of Starbucks' anti-bias training: I don't think it was damage control. This isn't the first time the company has been upfront about social issues. I think they went too far by saying everyone come in, but I think he made a point that Starbucks is a place you feel welcome. (00:30)

On the market response to Starbucks' controversy: Analyst and the investment community is looking at the growth prospects and This is not really a factor in terms of owning stock and investing in the company. (2:38)

On how Trump affects the markets: You have to look on the affect on business first. The corporate tax cut had a major impact. The business sector has seen growth, no doubt about it, but the consumer and the retail sales picture is murky. While we do see growth now come 2019 and 2020 we will see it slow down. (3:13)

On the up and down of the market: Right now there's definitely some uncertainty about the China situation. Yesterday there was uncertainty about a trade war and then today a comfort level in terms of where that is going. I would not focus on short term moves. (6:02)
