(VIDEO) ‘Roseanne’ Cancelled: Controversial TV Star Apologized For Twitter Rant … Should That Matter?
 
ABC's highest rated sitcom "Roseanne" was abruptly cancelled Tuesday just hours after Roseanne Barr went on on a "racially charged" twitter rant.

On Tuesday, Tom Shillue began his show by asking did @ABCNetwork overreact?

Tom pointed out that Roseanne apologized for her Twitter rant and removed her jokes. It apparently didn't matter to the network.

"Should it matter?," Tom asked.
