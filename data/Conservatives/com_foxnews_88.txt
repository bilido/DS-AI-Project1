Todd Starnes spoke with Senate candidate, Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) just hours before President Trump was expected to put his support behind her at a campaign rally in Nashville.

Rep. Blackburn told Starnes why people should vote for her to replace the retiring Republican Senator Bob Corker.

"Tennesseans know that they can depend on me to defend life at all stages. They know that they can depend on me to defend the Second Amendment and all of our rights and freedoms. They know that I say there are the big five we have to protect every single day: faith, family, freedom, hope and opportunity. And I am going to work on that," Rep. Blackburn said.
