Mom of 10 intentionally burned baby with straightener: cops
 
A 28-year-old mom of 10 is accused of burning her infant child on purpose with a hair straightener, according to reports.

Stephanie Nicole Rodriguez of Lubbock, Texas, was indicted by a grand jury Tuesday on a charge for intentional injury to a child causing serious bodily injury, news station KCBD reported.

Rodriguez was arrested earlier this month in connection to the August 2017 incident in which she reportedly burned her 7-month-old baby on the arm with a straightener.

The indictment alleged that the mom “intentionally or knowingly” hurt the child with a “deadly weapon.”

Just hours after she was arrested, Rodriguez was rushed to the hospital where she delivered her 10th child, a baby girl, news station KLBK reported. The newborn was placed in the custody of child protective services, police said.

She told authorities that her other children were either adopted or placed in the custody of relatives.

Rodriguez was released from the hospital and returned to Lubbock County Detention Center, where she remains held on $27,000 bond.
