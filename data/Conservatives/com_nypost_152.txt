The Mets are heating up!

Some 60 firefighters rushed to Citi Field Wednesday — after flames erupted in a display case in the rotunda near the stadium’s main entrance.

The case caught fire at around 3:45 p.m., officials said. But sprinklers were automatically activated and the flames were extinguished before FDNY even arrived, officials said.

A metal detector was also damaged in the blaze, stadium employees said.

The cause is under investigation.

The Mets were in Atlanta when flames erupted.

Citi Field workers said they’re confident the mess would be completely cleaned up by the time fans show up Thursday night for the Mets next home date, against the Chicago Cubs.

“They’re cleaning the area up right now. There’s a game here tomorrow,” one worker said. “It will be spotless by then (Thursday), like nothing happened.”
