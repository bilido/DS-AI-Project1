Army vet who stabbed ex-Knick heads back to jail
 
​He nicked a Knick and hasn’t been able to stay out of trouble since.

​A US Army vet who ​got a slap on the wrist for stabbing ​ex-Knick​s player Chris Copeland​ ​and then blew the sweetheart deal, landing himself behind bars for six months, ​has now violated his probation​ ​​and will have to serve another year.

Shevoy Bleary-Murdock ​had initially​ worked out ​a plea deal for what amounted to about a week in jail — served on weekends — and five years’ probation in exchange for a guilty plea to stabbing Copeland outside a Chelsea nightclub in 2015.

​But the 25-year-old​ ​was pulled over in a Mercedes-Benz in Brooklyn just three days after he took the June 2016 deal, and was busted with 17 forged credit cards, marijuana and an unloaded high-capacity magazine, prosecutors said. Judge Gregory Carro sentenced him to six months behind bars.

This time around,​ Bleary-Murdock was busted ​in New Jersey on assault charges, and found himself back before Carro on Wednesday after serving 10 months behind bars for his ID theft case.

Carro slapped him with the year-long jail term for violating his probation. Bleary-Murdock was immediately taken into custody.

Bleary-Murdock’s lawyer did not immediately return a message.
