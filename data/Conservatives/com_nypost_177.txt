New York Times corrects crowd size estimate of Trump rally
 
Sometimes size does matter.

After a blistering attack from President Trump, The New York Times on Wednesday corrected a story about the size of the crowd at the president’s Nashville rally the night before.

The Gray Lady initially reported that 1,000 people gathered at the arena in Tennessee to see Trump endorse Marsha Blackburn for the Senate.

The paper revised the number upward to 5,500 based on a tally from the local fire marshal and corrected the story.

“President @realDonaldTrump is correct about his crowd last night,” wrote Times reporter Julie Davis in a tweet. “My estimate was way off, and we have corrected our story to reflect the fire marshal’s estimate of 5,500 people. When we get it wrong, we say so.”

The correction followed another blistering 280-character missive from Trump about his hometown broadsheet.

“The Failing and Corrupt @nytimes estimated the crowd last night at “1000 people,” when in fact it was many times that number – and the arena was rockin’,” Trump wrote. “This is the way they demean and disparage. They are very dishonest people who don’t “get” me, and never did!”

The New York Times posted a $55.5 million operating profit last quarter.
