“Roseanne” reruns are cancelled, too.

Viacom is pulling the original version of the sitcom from its cable networks after star and creator Roseanne Barr went on a racist Twitter rant Tuesday, according to Deadline.com.

As of Wednesday, the show will be scrubbed from schedules on Paramount Network, TV Land and CMT.

ABC canceled its revival of the show when Barr compared former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett to ​an ape and accused Jewish billionaire George Soros of being a “Nazi” who “turned in his fellow Jews.”
