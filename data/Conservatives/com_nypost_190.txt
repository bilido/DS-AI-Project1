Smart toilet paper could be used to fight obesity
 
Smart toilet paper could be used in the future to help fight obesity, say British scientists.

The claim comes after researchers made a breakthrough in understanding the biological processes that lead to pot bellies.

The findings published in Nature Genetics show the epidemic is vastly down to what we eat — rather than our genes.

And it identifies the series of actions in the gut that fuel the build-up of fat around the waist.

First author Dr Jonas Zierer, of King’s College London, said: “This new knowledge means we can alter the gut environment and confront the challenge of obesity from a new angle that is related to modifiable factors such as diet and the microbes in the gut.”

“This is exciting because unlike our genes and our innate risk to develop fat around the belly, the gut microbes can be modified with probiotics, with drugs or with high fiber diets.”

Tim Spector, head of King’s College London’s Twin Research Group, said: “This exciting work… shows the importance to our health and weight of the thousands of chemicals that gut microbes produce in response to food.”

“Knowing that they are largely controlled by what we eat rather than our genes is great news and opens up many ways to use food as medicine. In the future, these chemicals could even be used in smart toilets or as smart toilet paper.”

In the largest study of its kind, they analyzed the community of chemicals in the stools of 500 pairs of twins.

Known as the “fecal metabolome,” it enabled them to build a picture of how the gut drives these processes and distributes fat.

Under the microscope the stool samples revealed signs, or biomarkers, of internal fat around the waist.

This showed how microbial chemicals lead to the development of fat around the waist in some, but not all the twins.
