Vogue magazine lays off 8 staffers
 
As part of the ongoing cuts at Condé Nast, eight people were chopped at Vogue, the flagship title headed by Anna Wintour.

Among those who The Post has confirmed were laid off were Director of Communications Zara Rahim and Senior Market Editor Kirby Marzec. News of the cuts was first reported by Business of Fashion.

The moves are part of the rolling cuts that are re-shaping Condé Nast, which was said to have lost more than $100 million last year.

As part of that, earlier this year, Vanity Fair cut about 20 editorial staff, and Glamour cut around 10 in a single day of bloodletting.

Radhika Jones, who replaced Graydon Carter at the helm of VF earlier this year, has slowly been filling about half the spots. Former New Republic Editor Eric Bates — most recently features editor at New York magazine — this week was tapped to be executive editor, news and investigations. Daniel Kile, a former Time Inc. public relations executive, was named executive editor, events and strategy.
