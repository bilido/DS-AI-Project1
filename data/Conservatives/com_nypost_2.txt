Melania Trump blasts media, conspiracy theories on Twitter
 
First lady Melania Trump took to Twitter on Wednesday to dispel rumors about her health, which have swirled following her kidney surgery earlier this month.

“I see the media is working overtime speculating where I am & what I’m doing,” the first lady tweeted. “Rest assured, I’m here at the @WhiteHouse w/my family, feeling great, & working hard on behalf of children & the American people!”

Trump, 48, has not been seen in public since May 10, four days before she underwent the procedure at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on May 14.

However, she was spotted around the White House as recently as Tuesday afternoon.

“Not that this will deter the conspiracy theorists, but I saw the First Lady walking with her aides in the West Wing yesterday afternoon,” CNBC correspondent Eamon Javers tweeted on Wednesday.
