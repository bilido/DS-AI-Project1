Jimmy Kimmel Under Fire For Defending Roseanne On Twitter

Roseanne Barr has made her fair share of enemies in the last 24 hours (and, frankly, in the last 20-odd years), but a surprising player has now stepped up and is asking that we go a little easier on the disgraced sitcom star. Jimmy Kimmel, who poked fun at Roseanne‘s cancelation on his own show last night, took to Twitter this afternoon in what appeared to be an attempt to diffuse the social media firestorm following her own bizarre tweet spree and attacks from users far and wide:

While Kimmel seemed to have the best intentions at heart – Barr apparently does suffer from bipolar disorder, ADHD, and multiple personality disorder – celebrities, writers, and more quickly called him out for what read to some as an attempt to justify her racist comments.

Mental health advocates and individuals with mental illness also called out Kimmel, warning him that it was dangerous to blame racism on her disorders:

Meanwhile, Barr has spent the afternoon backpedaling on previous comments, claiming that “one stupid joke” should not tarnish her hard-earned reputation and retweeting those who have come to her defense:

Barr has not yet acknowledged Kimmel’s tweet, but it seems like it’s only a matter of time. (Some have pointed out that there’s also the possibility that Kimmel was kidding, but this seems incredibly unlikely). At this point, Kimmel will probably end up addressing the controversy on his show tonight.

And so the Roseanne saga continues.
