These fishermen are cleaning up your plastic waste
 
A fishing boat takes part in the "Arcipelago Pulito" project in the Tyrrhenian Sea in Livorno, Italy. As part of the project in Tuscany, fishermen bring ashore the plastic they have collected on their fishing trips for recycling at a specialized plant. The project is the result of an agreement among the Tuscan Region, the Ministry of the Environment, Unicoop Firenze and Revet Recycling under the supervision of the coast guard of Tuscany. About 10 percent of the volume of each fish haul is plastic waste.
