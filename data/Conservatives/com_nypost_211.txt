Women behind bars share their struggles with addiction
 
Inmate Christy Wilson, 29. "One of the things that bothers me the most is my son came to visit me in jail and he was like,' Mom, please don't make me come and visit you here again.' It's hard. To see that little face, that gives me all the strength I need. How could you do something like that to someone you love so dearly? It's not the you don't love your kids but the addiction takes hold of you and you'll do anything you have to do to get it. It's a vicious cycle that never ends unless you quit drugs."
