Deadbeat son: My parents are ‘harassing’ me with small talk
 
The last few days before his eviction date could not be more awkward for the upstate deadbeat who is being tossed from his parents’ house, because, he says, they are spending the time torturing him with their strongest weapon — small talk.

“I think it’s really harassing, honestly,” Michael Rotondo, 30, groused to The Post on Wednesday.

“You throw me out of the house. You’re not going to give me more time. Why would you continue to try to talk to me? I’m not interested in doing that.”

Rotondo is under court order to vacate the Syracuse-area home of Christina and Mark Rotondo by noon on Friday.

The slacker said he’s packed 80 percent of his belongings — mostly books, computer equipment and legal papers — by chucking it into boxes.

“I had recently helped a friend move, so I know how to take a pile of junk and just put into a box, which is what I did,” he explained. “You just throw everything into a box and just worry about it later.”

The jobless Rotondo earned $3,000 last week by appearing on conspiracy-theorist Alex Jones’ radio show in Austin, Texas.

That money, he said, will keep him afloat for the next few months.

Rotondo said he was diagnosed in 2007 with paranoid schizophrenia but stopped taking his medication because he doesn’t believe he’s mentally ill.

“They’re always telling me I need help, but they’re the ones causing the problem,” he said of his parents.
