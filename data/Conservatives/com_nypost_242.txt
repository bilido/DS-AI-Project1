Will Felder kill a common-sense traffic safety program?
 
In their rush to flee Albany and run for re-election, will state legislators leave common-sense traffic-safety measures on the committee-room floor?

The city’s school-zone speed camera program is set to expire June 30 unless the Legislature acts. That is, unless state Sen. Simcha Felder (D-Brooklyn) drops his opposition.

Felder, a Democrat who provides the Republicans their one-vote majority, is using that muscle to stall the bill — though Sen. Martin Golden (R-Brooklyn) supports renewal.

School-zone cameras save lives. At locations with a camera, injuries in traffic crashes (to pedestrians, cyclists and motorists) have dropped nearly 15 percent a year since 2012.

Installing cameras at another 150 school zones and extending the program through 2022, as Mayor de Blasio requests, will save more lives — and let more children and parents feel safe on their way to school.

The Assembly approved the measure months ago. On the other hand, it has two other traffic-safety bills stalled — reluctant to hike any penalties on any law-breakers.

The Senate has already OK’d legislation to 1) suspend licenses after two school-zone speeding tickets within 18 months, and 2) make it a felony to injure someone while driving with a suspended or revoked license.

We started flagging the first reform in January, after a truck driver whose license had been suspended nine times killed a Brooklyn kid. The need for the school-zone-suspension rule became clear after the March accident that killed two Park Slope toddlers.

Senate Majority Leader John Flanagan and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie need to crack heads and get the right things done.
