Miguel Andujar OK after collision scare
 
Miguel Andujar collided with Houston’s Yuli Gurriel trying to make a play at third in the seventh, but remained in the game after being looked at by the training staff.

Andujar said he got hit in the left side of his head, but was OK and Aaron Boone added: “I don’t think it’s anything big.”

Aaron Hicks was hitless in 15 at-bats before a sixth-inning double in the Yankees’ 5-3 win over the Astros Wednesday night at the Stadium, but Boone said he still values what he brings to the team.

“When he’s not getting hits, he’s getting on base 35 percent of the time,’’ Boone said. “And he’s a real center fielder that can really legitimately play center field. He has power and in a lot of ways is still a young player who’s still developing and is highly productive.”

That’s Boone’s polite way of saying you shouldn’t expect to see Clint Frazier back in The Bronx anytime soon, regardless of how well he hits with Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.

“[Frazier] continues to grow and establish himself as a big part of our future,’’ Boone said. “Aaron is a really good player for us and plays a premium defensive position. You can’t just fire anyone out in center field.’’

Boone said Luis Severino would start one of the games of the doubleheader on Monday in Detroit and the team was discussing who would pitch the other game. Boone said he preferred to have a starter as opposed to using the game as a bullpen day.

Adam Warren threw three scoreless innings for Double-A Trenton. … Austin Romine extended his career-high hitting streak to nine games, and is 12-for-26 in that stretch.
