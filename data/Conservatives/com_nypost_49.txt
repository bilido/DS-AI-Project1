Marilyn Monroe and Joe DiMaggio’s love nest gets a facelift
 
The digs that Hollywood superstar Marilyn Monroe briefly called home during her short-lived marriage to New York Yankees legend Joe DiMaggio in 1954 has been transformed into a $1,200-a-night hotel room at the Lexington Hotel.

It’s now known as the Norma Jeane Suite, after Monroe’s given name.

Following their honeymoon, they settled into the Lexington, located at 511 Lexington Ave. at 48th Street.

This 600-square-foot suite — which features a living room, a dining area, a 200-square-foot private terrace — is also where Marilyn lived when she shot her iconic skirt-blowing scene in “The Seven Year Itch,” which was filmed just a few blocks away on Lexington Avenue and 52nd Street.

Vintage photos and memorabilia act as a shrine to the couple.

The suite, formerly called the Centerfield, was available to rent before; the new facelift is courtesy of interior design firm Fringe.
