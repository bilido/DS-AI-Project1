Controversial Hamptons mansion on market for $17.5M
 
A house at 20 Hook Pond Lane in East Hampton whose massive size has previously enraged neighbors — including Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont and ex-presidential candidate — is on the market for $17.5 million.

The seller is developer Jeffrey Schneider, who bought the property for $5.95 million last year.

Many locals also didn’t like that the zoning board granted Schneider permission to build a 748-square-foot garage in the front yard as part of a new house on the property. (Dean’s family has owned a place nearby for many years.)

But not all have objected.

Steve Raia, a partner at Il Mulino, the Italian restaurant that opened over Memorial Day weekend in nearby Wainscott, recently toured the property. The home was once owned by Dwight Chapin, who worked as deputy assistant to disgraced President Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal.

The 10,000-square-foot home with seven bedrooms sits on 1.6 acres, and comes with views of Hook Pond and the Atlantic Ocean.

Extravagant details include a 133-inch projection television, a glass-encased wine cellar, a gym, a steam room and an infrared sauna.

A third-floor observation deck features a gas fireplace and a wet bar. There’s also an outdoor kitchen, a pool and a pool house.

The listing brokers are Corcoran’s Charlie Esposito and Debbie Brenneman.
