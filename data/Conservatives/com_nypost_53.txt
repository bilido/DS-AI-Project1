Rental downstairs from Bowie’s old penthouse is $28K per month
 
The late David Bowie famously owned the penthouse at 285 Lafayette St.

That’s where shattered fans mourned his loss by transforming the ground outside the Nolita building into an impromptu shrine following his 2016 death. Bowie bought the spread for $4 million in 1999, and his widow Iman still lives there.

Now a three-bedroom apartment on the third floor of the building is on the market as a fully furnished rental for $28,000 a month.

The 3,175-square-foot perch features a corner living room with eight windows “at treetop level” overlooking St. Michael’s Chapel on Mulberry Street.

Details include floorboards, posts and beams made from reclaimed oak. Building amenities include a common landscaped roof garden with seating and an outdoor kitchen.

Other building residents, over the years, have included Ian Schrager and Courtney Love. The listing broker is Corcoran’s Dorothy Zeidman.
