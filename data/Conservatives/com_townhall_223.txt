Anti-Establishment Landslide In Italy Looks Increasingly Likely

Sergio Mattarella's appointment of an IMF technocrat to head Italy is about to backfire on him miserably.

I have been following Italian polls quite closely and I suspect the Eurozone nannycrats are doing the same. If so, they are about ready to puke.

The last three polls show support for Lega at 26%. 25%, and 27.5%. Meanwhile the Five Star Movement (M5S) has been in a tighter range of 29% to 30%.

ZeroHedge made this observation.

However, I would not be surprised in the least to find a 60% turnout for Lega and M5S.

Get Out the Vote

The above Tweet by Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio will fire up the rank and file. Lega leader Matteo Salvini will do the same.

Brussels Fearmongering

Without a doubt, EMU (Eurozone) and EU officials will run a blistering fear mongering campaign in support of someone (anyone) else.

The irony of the tactic is the most likely party is Forza Italia led by Silvio Berlusconi, the very person the EMU forced out of office previously.

The EU backing Berlusconi will likely backfire.
