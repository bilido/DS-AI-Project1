Trump Tweets on ABC's Apology to Valerie Jarrett: They Never Called to Apologize for Insulting Me
 
President Trump commented in a tweet Wednesday about the fact that Disney CEO Bob Iger called former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett to apologize for an offensive tweet posted by Roseanne Barr.

The president said that Iger “never called President Donald J. Trump to apologize for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC.”

Bob Iger of ABC called Valerie Jarrett to let her know that “ABC does not tolerate comments like those” made by Roseanne Barr. Gee, he never called President Donald J. Trump to apologize for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC. Maybe I just didn’t get the call? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2018

Disney owns ABC and Barr’s show ‘Roseanne’ was cancelled Tuesday in light of her tweet. Iger called Jarrett ahead of ABC’s announcement to let her know.

“He wanted me to know before he made it public that he was canceling the show,” Jarrett said Tuesday. She called the incident a “teaching moment.”

"Roseanne's Twitter statement is abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values, and we have decided to cancel her show," ABC said in a brief statement.

Barr tweeted about Jarett Tuesday: "Muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby=vj." She deleted the tweet and initially apologized Tuesday but then retweeted supporters defending the tweet Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning.

Many in the media pointed out that White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders had told reporters yesterday that President Trump was focused on other issues when she was asked about the 'Roseanne' show's cancellation.
