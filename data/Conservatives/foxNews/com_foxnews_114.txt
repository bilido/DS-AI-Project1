Republican Georgia gubernatorial candidates Casey Cagle and Brian Kemp are heading to a July runoff election after Tuesday's primary. While Cagle, the state's Lieutenant Governor, and Kemp, Georgia's Secretary of State, emerged at the top of a somewhat crowded GOP field of candidates, neither won more than 50 percent of the vote to avoid a July 24 runoff.

Todd Starnes spoke recently with both Cagle and Kemp, who explained why their positions on issues like immigration and the Second Amendment should appeal to true conservatives.

"It's a bunch of do-gooders and they are willing to put the safety of our citizens at risk and I'm just not willing to do that and so you've got to push back and we did.

Cagle said about sanctuary city legislation.

"I would urge conservatives to look at my record. Who's been standing up over the last eight and a half years, fighting the left, standing up for our values, who actually has a record of doing that?" Kemp said
