(VIDEO) Lou Dobbs Goes Off On #SpyGate: Trey Gowdy Is A “Phony”, Media Is Trying To Frame The President
 
Lou Dobbs isn't holding back his anger when it comes to Mueller investigation.

The Fox Business host says the idea that the FBI and Democrats spied on the Trump Campaign is the single biggest scandal in American history.

On Friday's show, Dobbs sat down with Tom Shillue to discuss the latest on the Russian probe and allegations that the intelligence community spied on the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential race.

From the Robert Mueller's investigation team of Democrats to the media's attempts to frame the President, Dobbs told Tom he thinks this is all part of plot to attack, assault and stop Donald Trump's presidency.

Dobbs says he also doesn't trust some of the Republicans who are apparently fighting for the President. For example, He says Trey Gowdy is "phony" who did nothing to hold Hillary Clinton accountable for Benghazi.
