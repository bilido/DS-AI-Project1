Dana Perino, former White House Press Secretary, co-host of Fox News Channel's "The Five" and host of "The Daily Briefing" and Chris Stirewalt Fox News Politics Editor and host of "Power Play", run through the daily goings on in the world of politics.

This week, Chris joins Dana from Morgantown, West Virginia a day after FOX's coverage of the GOP Senate Primary debate. Along with post-debate analysis they hit on DNC infighting, Vice President Pence's comments about Sheriff Joe Arpaio and the importance of pepperoni roles in our society.

Plus, for the first time since the West Virginia Day debacle of 2017, Chris tries his hand at Mountaineer based trivia.
