President Donald Trump call "SPYGATE", or the allegations that the FBI had informants talk to members of the Trump campaign, the biggest scandal in American history.

On Thursday's show, Former Trump Campaign Adviser Roger Stone joined Tom Shillue to support Trump's theory that the SPYGATE is a massive scandal worse than Watergate.

According to Stone, he thinks an investigation in to the Russian probe and its orgins will expose an abuse of power by the government. And it wasn't just some rogue agents, according to Stone. He says this scandal goes directly to President Obama.
