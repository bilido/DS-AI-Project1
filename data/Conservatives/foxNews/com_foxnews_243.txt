Bush, 93, arrived in Maine last week, according to his spokesman, Jim McGrath, who shared a photo of his arrival in Kennebunkport. The trip came about a month after the death of his wife, former first lady Barbara Bush.

Bush has spent part of every summer in Kennebunkport since his childhood, except while serving as a naval aviator during World War II.
