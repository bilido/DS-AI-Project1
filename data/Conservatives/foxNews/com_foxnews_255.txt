For some teens, it’s due to a lack of transportation and reluctance to obtain a driver’s license and for others it’s generally an affluence issue, according Tamra Kennedy, who runs several Taco John’s restaurants in the Midwest.

“We worked hard as a generation to earn the things that we have and we want to pass that on to the next generation,” Kennedy told Stuart Varney on “Varney & Co.” on Wednesday.

Even so, Kennedy said she’s having difficulties finding teenagers to fill jobs at her fast-food franchises, and is putting the onus on the fast-food industry to fix the problem.
