WATCH: Dale Earnhardt's Grandson Honors America's Fallen at Memorial Day NASCAR Race
 
The grandson of NASCAR racing legend Dale Earnhardt said his team is honoring America's fallen heroes this Memorial Day weekend and will also present a $15,000 check to a related charity at Sunday's race.

Jeffrey Earnhardt, who will be driving the #55 Chevrolet, told Fox News that he and his team will be supporting the Angels of America's Fallen charity during the Coca-Cola 600 in Charlotte, N.C., on Sunday night.

Earnhardt, 28, said he is honored to partner with groups that support the family members of American service members who have been killed.

He said that there will be a lot of attention given to the young children whose parents have died in battle.

"It's something that I feel you don't really think about until it's brought to your attention," Earnhardt said.

He said that his car will be marked with names of fallen soldiers, and that two young children came to see his vehicle, as their parent's name was affixed to its door.

"They're touched because we have their dad's name on the car," the North Carolina native said. "It will be an emotional weekend."

Earnhardt is the nephew of recently-retired driver Dale Earnhardt Jr. and the son of former driver Kerry Earnhardt.

His grandfather, known to many as The Intimidator, was a consistent fan favorite and won seven Winston Cup (now Monster Energy Cup) championships, but was killed in a last-lap collision during the 2001 Daytona 500 at the age of 49.
