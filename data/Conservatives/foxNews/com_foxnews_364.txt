'They're Not Doing Their Jobs': Pirro Says DOJ Officials Should Be Impeached for Stonewalling Congress
 
Judge Jeanine Pirro said Friday that the Justice Department is "slow-walking" on turning over documents on the Russia investigation to members of Congress.

She called on House Republicans to get off their "duff" and hold officials in contempt if the documents are not produced.

"The people in the Department of Justice, whether it's Rod Rosenstein, I don't care who it is, they have to be impeached. They are not doing their job. ... They are stonewalling. They are ignoring congressional oversight," she said on "Fox & Friends."

Pirro disputed Rep. Adam Schiff's (D-Calif.) contention that President Trump is not being truthful about the FBI placing a "spy" in his campaign.

"Nothing we heard today has changed our view, that there is no evidence to support any allegation that the FBI, or any intelligence agency, placed a spy in the Trump campaign or otherwise failed to follow appropriate procedures and protocols," he said Thursday after a bipartisan group of lawmakers attended a classified briefing on the matter by Justice Department officials.

Pirro said Schiff and other Democrats are playing word games around the term "spy."

"It's all so Clinton-esque," she said.
