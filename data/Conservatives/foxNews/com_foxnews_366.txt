Gowdy Cautions Dems on Bipartisan Russia Meeting: Have an Open Mind and Don't 'Leak Like a Sieve'
 
House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy discussed the upcoming highly sensitive meeting about the Russia investigation -- a meeting involving Gowdy and President Trump, among others.

Thus far, Gowdy and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes of California are the only members of Congress set to join FBI Director Chris Wray, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and Justice Department official Edward O'Callaghan.

Top Democratic leaders Sen. Charles Schumer of New York and Nancy Pelosi of California wrote a letter to Wray and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, asking them to include more members of Congress, including their fellow Democrats.

They asked that the bipartisan "Gang of Eight" be privy to the meeting, at which the topic of an alleged federal spy inside the Trump campaign is expected to be discussed.

"I don't care who comes," Gowdy said. "The only thing I'd ask [is] if you show up, show up with an open mind and closed lips."

"In other words, don't leak like a sieve when we get through the meeting," he said, noting that as many as 60 House members have supported impeachment of Trump.

"Those are folks that don't have an open mind," he said.

Some of the Democrats who have voiced support for impeachment include Adriano Espaillat of New York City, Al Green of Houston, Maxine Waters of Los Angeles and Steve Cohen of Memphis.
