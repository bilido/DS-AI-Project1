'An Abuse of Power': Rep. Biggs Says Mueller Is Investigating a Person, Not a Crime
 
Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) is one of several Republican lawmakers calling for a second special counsel to probe alleged abuses by the FBI and Justice Department.

On "Happening Now" on Wednesday, Biggs said the only way to get to the bottom of apparent "improprieties" in the Russia and Hillary Clinton email probes is to investigate the investigators.

"We can't rely on them to investigate themselves. So we need to get a special counsel outside of them to get in there and investigate," Biggs explained.

He said the DOJ inspector general has been doing good work, but he's simply "overburdened," and a special counsel is necessary to get to the bottom of possible DOJ and FBI misconduct.

Biggs also expressed concern about the legitimacy of the basis of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, and how the probe has expanded far beyond its original scope.

"They're not going after crimes. They're not alleging that there were any crimes done," he said, noting that collusion -- even if it happened -- is not a crime in and of itself.

"They're just going through everything, trying to squeeze everybody, because they're investigating a person, not investigating a crime," Biggs said. "And that's an abuse of power. And if that's the case, then they themselves have committed crimes."
