'I Hate My Mom's Phone & I Wish She Never Had One': 2nd-Grader's Essay Goes Viral
 
A Louisiana second-grader's homework assignment is going viral and making parents across the nation question if they spend too much time on their cell phones.

Teacher Jen Adams Beason wrote in a since-deleted Facebook post that she assigned her students to write about an invention they wish had never been created.

She posted an essay in which one of her students picked the cell phone.

"I don't like the phone because my [parents] are on their phone every day ... I hate my mom's phone and I wish she never had one," the student wrote.

Beason revealed that out of 21 of her students, four of them wrote about this topic.

At the end of her post, Beason added the hashtags #getoffyourphones and #listentoyourkids.

According to a 2017 survey, half of parents found that using technology disrupted time with their children three or more times a day.
