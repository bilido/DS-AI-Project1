'This Isn't Right': Student Sues School for Not Allowing Him to Wear Trump Border Wall Shirt
 
An Oregon teenager is suing his school after administrators said he could not wear a pro-Trump border wall shirt in class.

Liberty High School senior Addison Barnes said he was asked to cover up his “Donald J. Trump Border Wall Construction Co.” shirt or go home earlier this year.

The shirt - which also features a 2016 Trump quote: “The wall just got 10 feet taller.” - was worn by Barnes in his “People and Politics” class on a day where immigration would be discussed.

Barnes told "Fox & Friends First" that one of his teachers hung up a poster supporting sanctuary cities for a whole year, with no action taken by the school.

On the day of the incident, he said he was told by an assistant principal that some students and a teacher were offended by his shirt and that he could either cover it up or go home.

"At first I covered it for a few minutes. Then I thought to myself this isn't right, this goes against the First Amendment and my beliefs, so I took the jacket off," said Barnes, 18, adding that a security officer then escorted him out of class.

Barnes said many of his peers support his lawsuit, even those who don't agree with him politically.
