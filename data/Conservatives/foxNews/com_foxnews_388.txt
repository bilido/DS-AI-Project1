Luntz: Pelosi Is So Unpopular, GOP Could Keep House Majority in Midterms
 
Republicans could keep their House majority in the House in November's midterms because House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is unpopular and many swing voters do not want her to retake the gavel as House speaker, according to pollster Frank Luntz.

The California Democrat has been a lightning rod for controversy in recent months, particularly for her infamous "crumbs" remark about the benefits of the GOP tax cuts.

On "The Ingraham Angle," Luntz said Pelosi is the "least popular, credible figure" in the Democratic Party right now, and Republicans should use that to their advantage.

“If Republicans could find some way to engineer a vote over who would be Speaker of the House in January of 2019, if they could engineer that vote, I would be prepared to say right now that the Republicans would keep the majority, because there are so many people out there -- swing voters -- who do not want Pelosi as speaker that one action would make a difference,” Luntz said.

He noted that Democrats are still more motivated and energized than Republicans to turn out in November, but the Democratic Party hasn't offered an alternative vision, just anti-President Trump, anti-GOP rhetoric.

"If the GOP can get a 'Pelosi vote' and energize their base, then they will keep the majority."

Ingraham noted that voters disagreed with Pelosi's views on a host of issues during a CNN town hall this week.

Luntz said Republicans are polling at their highest point in a year on the generic ballot question, with working women and mothers moving away from the Democrats.
