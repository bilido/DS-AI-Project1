'A Slow-Rolling Disaster': The Five Says That in CA, the 'Blue Wave' Is 'Crashing' for Dems
 
The panel on The Five reacted to reports that the Democrats' expected "blue wave" of victories is "crashing" into the California surf.

Dana Perino said that President Donald Trump's rising popularity in the Golden State has thrown four House races in Orange County, Calif. into jeopardy for the Democrats.

Due to the state's "jungle primary" system where the top two vote-getters make the general election ballot irrespective of the party, Democrats could be "shut out" of any number of those key races.

"Good news for America is bad news for the Democrats," Jesse Watters said.

Kimberly Guilfoyle said the state's governor's race could also be an unexpected problem for the Democrats.

She warned that Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), who is seeking term-limited Gov. Jerry Brown's (D) seat, could run be running too far to the left of even some Democrats. Newsom is Guilfoyle's ex-husband.

Businessman John Cox (R) is currently running second in the polls, Guilfoyle said, noting that Cox has been endorsed by Trump.

Other candidates in the jungle primary include former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa (D) and State Assemblyman Travis Allen (R-Huntington Beach).

The panel also discussed how California Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi's (D) "crumbs" remark has rung hollow for some of her neighbors.
