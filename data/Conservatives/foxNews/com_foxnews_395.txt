'I Don't Want to Be There': NY Man Evicted from Parents' House Responds to Publicity
 
A 30-year-old New York man was legally evicted from his parents' home in a Syracuse court ruling this week.

Michael Rotondo spoke to Martha MacCallum about his case and the publicity it has received.

MacCallum said Rotondo has been living at his parents' home in Onondaga County for eight years.

Rotondo said a February letter from his father is the first documented instance of being told he is no longer welcome to live there.

"I don't want to be there," Rotondo said. "It's not so much that I won't leave... I just need enough time."

Rotondo reportedly has no apparent job, owns a car that is in need of repairs and has a son -- but recently lost custody of the child.

He said he will accept a three-month window to vacate his parent's house.

"You've had eight years," MacCallum said.
