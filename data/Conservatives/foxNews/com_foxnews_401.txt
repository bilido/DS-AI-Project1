'Outrageous Abuse of Our Intelligence Agencies': Ingraham Blasts Clapper for Trump Spy 'Lie'
 
In her Angle commentary, Laura Ingraham ripped Obama-era Director of National Intelligence James Clapper for purportedly lying about surveilling members of the Trump presidential campaign.

Ingraham said a key exchange involving Clapper occurred in 2013 under oath before Congress.

Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden asked Clapper if his agency collected or retained information of private citizens, to which Clapper answered in the negative.

"No sir, not wittingly," Clapper said.

Ingraham said that exchange was contradicted by Clapper's interview on "The View" where he appeared to admit to surveilling Trump associates.

"It's amazing to me that Clapper continues to go on national TV and... denies what we know to be true," she said.

She called Clapper's actions, and reports a federal spy was placed inside the Trump campaign, an "outrageous abuse of our intelligence and law enforcement agencies."

Ingraham said the Obama administration likely knew about the allegations involving Trump, and were "desperate to wrap up the Hillary [email] probe" in order to "collect dirt on Trump."
