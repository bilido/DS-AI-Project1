Pakistan to hold parliamentary elections on July 25
 
Pakistan says it will hold parliamentary and provincial assembly elections on July 25.

It will be the first vote since Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was removed from office by the Supreme Court for concealing financial assets abroad. His party is expected to do well, despite coming under pressure from anti-corruption authorities, and despite Sharif's recent criticism of the powerful military's role in politics.

The National Assembly will finish its term on May 31. It is only the third time in history that the lower house of parliament has finished its five-year term. The constitution mandates that new elections be held within 60 days of the term ending.

A statement from the office of the presidency late Saturday says President Mamnoon Hussain approved the election commission's suggested date.
