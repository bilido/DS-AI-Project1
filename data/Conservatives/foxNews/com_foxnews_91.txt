Burkina Faso resumes ties with China after Taiwan break
 
The West African Nation of Burkina Faso has formally resumed diplomatic ties with China after breaking off relations with Taiwan, which now has just 18 diplomatic allies.

Burkina Faso's decision was the latest blow to Taiwan, a self-governing democracy that Beijing claims as its own territory and has been trying to isolate on the global stage.

Earlier this month, the Dominican Republic established diplomatic relations with China and severed ties with Taiwan.

China's Foreign Ministry said a document establishing diplomatic ties was signed Saturday in Beijing between Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Burkina Faso's foreign minister, Alpha Barry.

On Friday, Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen tweeted that "China's growing pressure will only strengthen other countries' support for us."

She added defiantly, "We will never back down."
