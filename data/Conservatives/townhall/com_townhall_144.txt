The Virginian-Pilot: 2 Virginia Beach council members propose budget with no tax increases

Residents looking for relief from flooding without paying more in taxes have at least two champions on the City Council. Council members John Moss and Jessica Abbott have come up with an alternative to City Manager Dave Hansen’s proposed budget, which calls for a real estate tax increase of 1.25 cents per $100 of assessed value to help pay for full-day kindergarten and a stormwater fee increase of 2.5 cents per day for five years to make a dent in $450 million in needed drainage infrastructure repairs and upgrades.

Richmond Times-Dispatch: Virginia Supreme Court takes first look at pipeline survey law

The issue is new to the Virginia Supreme Court, but not to landowners whose property already has been surveyed without their permission for two proposed interstate natural gas pipelines.

The majority of the additional revenue from the tax increase will cover the cost to open and operate the new middle school for the first year.
