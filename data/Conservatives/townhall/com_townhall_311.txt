South Korean President Has Surprise Meeting With Kim Jong Un to Discuss U.S. Summit
 
South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un met Saturday to discuss North Korea’s possible summit with Trump and the denuclearization agreement they signed when they met for the first time in over a decade last month, according to a statement from South Korea.

"The two leaders exchanged views frankly in order to make the U.S.-N.K. summit talks happen successfully and to carry out the 4.27 Panmunjeom Declaration," Yoon Young Chan, a South Korean presidential spokesman said, citing the agreement signed in last month’s meeting between the leaders.

Saturday's meeting took place on the North Korean side of Panmunjom, a village between the North-South border in the Korean Peninsula’s Demilitarized Zone.

President Trump cancelled the summit with Kim Jong Un Thursday citing threats from the regime and an unwillingness on North Korea’s end to work out logistical details for the meeting.

However, after the regime replied to the cancellation with a “productive” statement, Trump signaled that the meeting may still happen.

We’ll see what happens," Trump told reporters Friday. “We’ll see what happens. It could even be the 12th. We’re talking to them now. They very much want to do it. We’d like to do it. We’re going to see what happens.”
