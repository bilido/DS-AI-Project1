It's Official: Republicans Introduce Resolution for Second Special Counsel to Investigate FBI and FISA Abuse
 
Twenty-five House Republicans have introduced a resolution officially calling for a second Special Counsel to investigate FBI misconduct and FISA abuse during the 2016 presidential election.

"Here's the now filed 12 pg[page] H.Res.907 w[ith] 25 original cosponsors, detailing misconduct at highest levels of DOJ/FBI re FISA abuse, how/why Clinton email probe ended & Trump-Russia probe began. Also calls for 2nd Special Counsel," Republican Congressman Lee Zeldin tweeted Friday.

As mentioned, the legislation is twelve pages long and details two dozen reasons - including the handling of the criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton - why the Special Counsel is necessary.

"Expressing the sense of Congress that the Attorney General of the United States should appoint a Special Counsel to investigate misconduct at the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation, including an investigation of abuse of the FISA warrant process, how and why the Hillary Clinton probe ended, and how and why the Donald Trump-Russia probe began," the resolution states. "Whereas there is an urgent need for the appointment of a second Special Counsel in light of evidence that raises critical concerns about decisions, activities, and inherent bias displayed at the highest levels of the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) regarding FISA abuse, how and why the Hillary Clinton email probe ended, and how and why the Donald Trump-Russia probe began."

"The concerns of the American people are serious and the issues requiring an immediate, unbiased, independent, and thorough investigation are broad," it continues.

Meanwhile, DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz is expected to release his investigation into many of the same issues next week.

The resolution can be read in full below.
