Mattis Says There May Be 'Good News' Coming on North Korea Summit
 
U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis told reporters Friday that “we have got some, possibly some good news on the Korea summit, where it may, if our diplomats can pull it off, may have it back on even.”

Mattis’s remarks follow Trump’s comments earlier Friday that the summit could still happen on June 12 as originally planned.

“That is a usual give and take, you know, of trying to put together big summits and stuff. The diplomats are still at work,” Mattis explained.

“I am optimistic that the diplomats are working, our diplomats are working very hard to make this happen," he added.

Asked if the U.S. would potentially restart military exercises in the region, Mattis replied that they are not "changing anything right now, it is steady as she goes."

"The diplomats are in the lead and in charge,” he said, “and we give them our best wishes to have a fruitful way forward."

Trump cancelled the summit Thursday following threats from the regime and an unwillingness on North Korea’s end to work out logistical details for the meeting.

However, after the regime replied to the cancellation with a “productive” statement, Trump signaled that the meeting may still happen.

We’ll see what happens," Trump told reporters Friday. “We’ll see what happens. It could even be the 12th. We’re talking to them now. They very much want to do it. We’d like to do it. We’re going to see what happens.”
