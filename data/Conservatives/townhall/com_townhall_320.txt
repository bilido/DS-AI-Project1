Armed Bystanders Stop Shooter in Oklahoma
 
When one man walked into an Oklahoma City restaurant and started shooting Thursday night, two armed bystanders were ready and waiting to stop him. The gunman, Alexander Tilghman, shot two people inside Louie's On The Lake, a restaurant located on Lake Hefner. The two victims, a woman and a female juvenile, underwent surgery but are going to survive. Another person was injured trying to escape. When the gunman walked back out into the parking lot, two armed people, Juan Carlos Nazario, 35, and Bryan Wittle, 39, shot him dead.
