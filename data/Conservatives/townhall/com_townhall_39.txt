Two Injured in Shooting at Indiana Middle School
 
UPDATE (2:11 p.m. ET): A student witness says a science teacher tackled the shooter to the ground.

The teacher “immediately ran at him, swatted a gun out of his hand and tackled him to the ground,” according to seventh-grader Ethan Stonebraker. “If it weren’t for him, more of us would have been injured for sure.”

UPDATE (11:33 a.m. ET): The Noblesville Police Department held a press briefing Friday following the shooting. They confirmed that a juvenile and an adult had been injured and are being treated at the hospital. The officials also noted, however, that a secondary threat has been leveled at the Noblesville High School. They have no information other than it is a communicated threat. The department is investigating both incidents. A follow up press conference will be held at 2 p.m. ET.
