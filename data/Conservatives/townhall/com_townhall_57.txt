'I Am Waiting': Trump Sends Message to Kim Jong Un
 
The canceled Singapore summit is “a tremendous setback” for North Korea and for the world, President Trump said at the White House Thursday and sending Kim Jong Un a letter noting his decision to scratch their planned meeting. It had to be done because of North Korea's recent aggressive rhetoric, including their nuclear threat and their insulting words for Vice President Mike Pence, Trump informed Kim Jong Un.

"Sadly, based on the tremendous anger open hostility displayed in your most recent statement, I feel it is inappropriate, at this time, to have this long-planned meeting," Trump wrote.

Trump is disappointed in the cancellation, but added in his White House address that the U.S. is "more ready than we have ever been before” should North Korea finally decide to cooperate.

North Korea “has the opportunity to end decades of oppression” by entering on path to denuclearization and by “joining the community of nations.” Trump "hopes" Kim Jong Un "does what is right for himself and his people, who are suffering greatly and needlessly."

North Koreans and South Koreans "deserve to be able to live together in harmony, prosperity and peace," he added. That can only happen "when the threat of nuclear weapons is removed."

When the North Korean leader "engages in constructive dialogue, I am waiting," Trump told Kim Jong Un. In the meantime, "the strong sanctions and maximum pressure campaign will continue."

"We will never compromise the safety and security of the United States of America."
