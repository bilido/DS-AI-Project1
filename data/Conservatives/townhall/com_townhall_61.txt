President Trump Praises NFL Owners For New National Anthem Policy
 
Yesterday the NFL released a new policy for players and whether they should stand for the National Anthem. The new rules, which were announced by Commissioner Roger Goodell, require any players on the field to stand in respect. Those who don't want to stand can stay in the locker room.

During an interview with Fox and Friends Thursday morning, President Trump applauded the move.

"You have to stand proudly for the national anthem or you shouldn't be playing, you shouldn't be there, maybe you shouldn't be in the country," Trump said. "I don’t think people should be staying in the locker rooms, but still I think it’s good. You have to stand proudly for the national anthem. You shouldn’t be playing, you shouldn’t be there. Maybe they shouldn’t be in the country."

President Trump put pressure on the NFL multiple times over the past two years through his Twitter feed. Ratings for games on television and arena attendance have plummeted since the protests started in 2016.
