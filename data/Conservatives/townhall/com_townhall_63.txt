Elon Musk Blasts Media's Hypocrisy, Proposes a Website to Track Credibility
 
Billionaire Elon Musk announced on Twitter Wednesday that he is thinking of starting a website to track the credibility of media outlets and even specific journalists.

Musk wrote that he would create a website where “the public can rate the core truth of any article & track the credibility score over time of each journalist, editor & publication.”

He added that he was thinking of calling it Pravda, which is the Russian word for truth and is the name of a newspaper for the Communist Party of the Russian Federation.

Even if some of the public doesn’t care about the credibility score, the journalists, editors & publications will. It is how they define themselves. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 23, 2018

Create a media credibility rating site (that also flags propaganda botnets) — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 23, 2018

Musk also criticized the media’s “holier-than-thou hypocrisy” and claimed that some in the media lost their credibility a long time ago, arguing that they respond to criticism by comparing critics to Trump.

The holier-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth, but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie, is why the public no longer respects them https://t.co/Ay2DwCOMkr — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 23, 2018
