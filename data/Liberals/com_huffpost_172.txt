Watch This Australian Man Go Swimming In A Huge Pit Of Beer Cans
 
There are two things you need to know about Australians, from an Australian. One, we’re an enterprising and ingenious people, and two, we love a drink.

One Aussie man has perfectly exemplified those characteristics by wading through an impressive collection of beer cans in a backyard shed, prompting some social media fans to nickname him “the Australian Scrooge McDuck.”

In a series of videos posted on Youtube, a woman identified as Tammy Penhall narrates the scene as she pans around the room in all its glory.

At one point, she films an unidentified older gentleman, dressed in a cap and tank top with a cigarette dangling from his mouth, who wades around among the cans.

“Some guys actually commented this would actually be their dream ball pit. Well, this is your dream beer pit, guys,” Penhall joked, adding, “The VB shed at its finest.”
