'Harry Potter' Star Matthew Lewis, AKA Neville Longbottom, Is Married
 
We now pronounce you wizard husband and wife.

“Harry Potter” actor Matthew Lewis, who played Neville Longbottom in the eight movies based on the magical book series, wed girlfriend Angela Jones in Italy over the weekend.

The British actor announced their nuptials by joking that he missed a performance of one of his favorite bands in Los Angeles, while he was tying the knot in another country.
