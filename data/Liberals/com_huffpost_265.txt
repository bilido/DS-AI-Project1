Queen Elizabeth's Previously Unseen Photo Of Prince Harry And Meghan Markle Is Too Cute
 
In an interview after the royal wedding, the photographer revealed how he got all of the children who were part of the ceremony to pose for the photos.

“I could hear the kids started crying in the background and there was some chaos,” he told People. “And then I heard this magic word behind me that was Smarties, which is obviously an English candy, much like M&Ms, and they were being bribed with one Smartie here and one Smartie there.”
