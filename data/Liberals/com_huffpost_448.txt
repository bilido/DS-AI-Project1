'Murdered' Journalist Arkady Babchenko Turns Up Alive At News Conference
 
Arkady Babchenko, the Russian journalist and Kremlin critic reported to have been shot dead in Kiev on Tuesday, has turned up alive in Ukraine.

Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, Vasily Gritsak, head of the Ukrainian Security Service, said the death had been staged in order to catch those who were trying to kill him.

Gritsak said the authorities had received information about a Russian plot to kill Babchenko and had managed to prevent it by faking the journalist’s death.

“I’m still alive,” Babchenko declared at the press conference after her took to the floor to applause and gasps.

“I know that sickening feeling when you bury a colleague. I’m sorry you had to go through this, but there was no other way.”

His wife, who reportedly found his body in a pool of blood in their flat, was unaware of the operation and thought he had been killed.
