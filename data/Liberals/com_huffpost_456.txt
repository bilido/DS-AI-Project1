Chris Pratt Responds To Fans Still Upset About Star-Lord's Actions In 'Infinity War'
 
Warning: Spoilers for “Avengers: Infinity War” below!

“Deadpool 2” and “Solo” may be new at the movie theater, but people still can’t stop talking about “Avengers: Infinity War,” which came out on April 27.

Some Marvel fans were upset by the way Chris Pratt’s character, Star-Lord, let his emotions get the best of him in a critical moment during the battle against the villain Thanos.

During a pivotal scene, Iron Man, Dr. Strange, Spider-Man and the Guardians of the Galaxy are holding Thanos in a trance as they try to wrestle his infinity gauntlet away from him. The infinity gauntlet, if adorned with all six infinity stones, would make Thanos essentially a god.

Just as they nearly have it, Star-Lord learns that Gamora, the woman he loves, has been killed by Thanos. In a rage, Star-Lord starts punching Thanos, which releases the villain from his trance and allows him to reclaim the gauntlet.

Some fans have given Star-Lord a tough time on social media.
