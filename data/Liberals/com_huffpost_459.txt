Ariana Grande And Pete Davidson Make It Official With 'Harry Potter' Photo
 
Yer a wizard, Ari.

Ariana Grande and “Saturday Night Live” star Pete Davidson have made their romance official with a photo of the duo essentially dressed up in “Harry Potter” cosplay.

Davidson shared an Instagram on Wednesday of himself and the pop star sporting their Hogwarts finest complete with sweatshirts repping two different houses. The comedian is a self-identifying Gryffindor, while Grande opted for the Slytherin house.

Davidson captioned the photo, “the chamber of secrets has been opened.”
