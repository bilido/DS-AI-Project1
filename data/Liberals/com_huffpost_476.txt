Pink Floyd Co-Founder Forms New Act To Play The Band's Earliest Songs Live
 
Pink Floyd co-founder Nick Mason is taking the group’s earliest tunes out on the road.

The drummer and Rock & Roll Hall of Famer has formed a new band called Nick Mason’s Saucerful of Secrets to play tunes from Pink Floyd’s pre-“Dark Side of the Moon” output.

“We’re not a tribute band,” Mason told Uncut last week. “It’s not important to play the songs exactly as they were, but to capture the spirit.”

After a series of shows over the past week in London, Mason announced he will take the band on the road for a European tour. (A full list of dates is posted on the band’s website.)

There’s no word yet if the tour will be extended to North America.
