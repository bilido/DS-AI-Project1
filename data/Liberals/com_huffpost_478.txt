Arjun Rampal And Mehr Jessia Have Announced Their Separation After 20 Years Of Marriage
 
After years of turbulent marriage, former models Arjun Rampal and Mehra Jessia have announced their separation. The couple had been married for 20 years.

In a statement released early this morning, Rampal and Jessia said that they were moving on in 'different directions.'

The statement said, "After a 20-year-long beautiful journey filled with love and beautiful memories, we would like to share, that all journeys have different paths. We feel that it is time for us to move on to different destinations henceforth. We have always been solid when it has come to us, we will continue to be solid for each other and our loved ones, as we embark upon a new journey."

The couple also asked the media to respect their privacy.

"Both of us being extremely private people feel strange to be making this statement, but such are the circumstances of our lives. Where the truth can get distorted and lost. We are a family, our love for each other is forever intact and we shall always be there for one another and most importantly, for our children Mahikaa and Myra. We would, therefore, appreciate our privacy through this time. Thank all for their support. Relationships can end, but love lives on. We won't be commenting on this any further," the statement said.
