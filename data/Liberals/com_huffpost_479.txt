So much talent. One person. We know, it’s a lot to comprehend. And if you’re overwhelmed, don’t worry, you’re not alone. On Thursday night, Cardi B tweeted that she thought Childish Gambino and Donald Glover looked extremely similar: “It’s amazing how Donald Glover and Childish Gambino look soo much alike,” she tweeted. “I think they secretly the same person.” The tweet has since been deleted, but a quick poking around on Twitter indicates that her sentiments have been shared by many:

Someone I know just found out that Donald Glover and Childish Gambino are the same person. What should I do? — Ice (@mattt_man11) May 26, 2018

I was individually a huge fan of Community, loved "Awaken, My Love!" and particularly 'Redbone' – and was completely blown away by 'This is America' the video.



and slowly slowly my mind is realising this is all the same person.

The movie hasn't started yet but there's no way any part of Solo is going to be better than the guy LOSING HIS MIND outside the theater realizing Childish Gambino and Donald Glover are the same person — Noah Gray? ✪ (@Noahhead) May 25, 2018

Co worker: I want to see #Solo



Me: isn’t Childish Gambino is that movie?



Co worker: I don’t know... but I’m either gonna see that or Dead Pool 2



Me: Oh okay, but Donald Glover is in that movie right?



Co worker: Yeah! That’s Lando

Xfinity didn't help at all as I slowly realized Donald Glover and Childish Gambino were the same person. Wait, he's also Lando Calrissian?! #SNL pic.twitter.com/vRSJ6L9w4c — Ray Devlin (@Ray_Devlin) May 6, 2018

Childish Gambino appeared on @nbcsnl, and my sister said she loved him. I asked her if she liked Donald Glover, and she said she didn’t know who he was 😬 #SNLFinale — Bruce Weiland III (@brucehweiland) May 20, 2018

I’m at work minding my business & my coworker asks me if I know Donald Glover. I said yes & he proceeds to ask doesn’t he look like Childish Gambino. I thought he was kidding, but he really didn’t know they were the same person lmao — AmBae (@__AMBERcrombie) May 23, 2018

So, whether you know him as Lando from “Solo: A Star Wars Story” or as his rap alter ego in “This Is America,” he’s still just one singular dude.
