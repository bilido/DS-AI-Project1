Boney Kapoor Holds Back Tears While Remembering Late Wife Sridevi In Emotional Video
 
Months after Sridevi's death on February 25, a video has surfaced on Tuesday morning where her husband Boney Kapoor is seen remembering his late wife, speaking fondly of her even as he held back tears.

Sridevi had died two months ago after accidentally drowning in a bathtub in Dubai and left the film industry in shock.

Boney Kapoor and his two daughters Khushi and Janhvi had collected the National Award for Sridevi that was posthumously awarded to her on May 3.

In the video, an emotional Kapoor was seen as saying, "When we got to know about the award, we felt very proud. But at the same time, we've been missing her since she left us," Kapoor is heard saying in the video, before his voice trails off. "Had she been here... she'd have been as proud..."

"She worked for 50 years and did 300 films. I miss her every second of my life. I am doing my best to play this double role of Mom and Dad," he said.

Janhavi Kapoor, who will be seen in the upcoming film Dhadak, said, "Both of us (Khushi and I) would like to thank the jury for recognizing the hard work, perseverance, and dedication that my mother has put into this role. It was very special to her and we are very happy that she is being appreciated for it."
