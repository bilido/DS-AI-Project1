All The Surprising Modern Touches At Prince Harry And Meghan Markle's Wedding
 
Here are all the ways they made their moment in the world spotlight stand out:

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle , now the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, took their vows Saturday at Windsor Castle and nudged the royal family into a more modern era, with a ceremony that bucked convention and tradition throughout.

Reverend Michael Curry’s energetic sermon...

Curry, who is American, spoke animatedly about love, God and Instagram in a long and partly improvised sermon before a bunch of royals who seemed... perplexed. He even evoked slavery as he spoke about “the dynamic power of love.”

It was just a bit of a shift from the sermon delivered at the 2011 wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

The reverend is the first black person to lead the Episcopal Church, which is part of the Anglican Communion like the Church of England.

Twitter lit up with Americans celebrating the significance of both Curry’s presence and his words.

...which included a quote by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

“We must discover the power of love, the redemptive power of love,” Curry said, quoting the late civil rights leader. “And when we discover that, we will be able to make of this old world a new world. Love is the only way.”
