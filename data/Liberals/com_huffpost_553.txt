Priyanka Chopra Is Dating Nick Jonas: US Media Reports
 
Priyanka Chopra, whose espionage drama Quantico just got canceled by ABC, is reportedly dating musician Nick Jonas.

"They are dating and it's brand new. It's a good match and they are both interested in each other," Us Weekly quoted a source as saying.

According to the report, the couple spent the Memorial Day weekend together and even attended the Beauty and the Beast live concert at the Hollywood Bowl.

Another source told People magazine, "They're flirtatious and have been hanging out and text all the time. The relationship is very casual."

The couple was first seen attending the Met Gala together last year which sparked rumors of a potential relationship.

In an interview with Jimmy Kimmel, Chopra said, "We were on the same table and we already know each other. So he was like 'Hey, you wanna go together?' And I was like 'Yeah, okay, let's go together.' It ended up working out."
