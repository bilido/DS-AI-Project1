This battery case makes your Amazon Echo Dot portable

The Amazon Echo Dot took the power of Amazon’s Echo and shrank it into a barely noticeable tabletop device. It’s been Amazon’s best selling Alexa product since its release in 2016, and it is one of the best selling smart home assistants overall. Despite the Echo Dot’s wide range of uses, from alerting you to weather changes to updating your shopping list, it has a surprising lack of mobility: the powerful home assistant still needs to be tethered to your wall to perform its smart home functions. You can maximize your Echo Dot’s usage from any corner of your home with the Amazon Echo Dot Smart Battery Case.

This smart battery case is an elegant solution that keeps your Dot charged and at the ready no matter what room of the house you’re in. It connects to the bottom of your Dot and flawlessly matches your smart assistant’s design, keeping your home’s surfaces clear of cord clutter while dramatically improving the Echo Dot’s portability. It packs enough juice to keep your Echo Dot powered for 10-15 hours, and its additional USB charging port lets you power other devices while you’re using Alexa’s array of features.

Make your Echo Dot a portable powerhouse with the Echo Dot Smart Battery Case for the low price of $26.99.
